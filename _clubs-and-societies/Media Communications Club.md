The Media Communications Club is a core CCA offered to students interested in digital media. It aims to engage students in specialised mediums by allowing them to learn and further develop their skills. The Media Communications Club collaborates with our school's Corporate Communications committee in capturing and managing visuals and aesthetics for school events.

KC’s Media Communications Club programme focuses mainly on photography and videography. This comprises digital video production, digital animation and photo-journalism. Some of the club’s activities include specialised training, workshops as well as opportunities for students to participate in ICT-based competitions (e.g. N.E.mation).

#### Programme (Upper sec)

*   In-house videography training
*   Photography &amp; videography services
*   Photography &amp; videography competitions

Over their years with the school, Media Communications Club members are given the opportunity to develop individual online portfolios. Each individual portfolio is a documentation of the work that each student has done over her secondary school years, and is often used as an added portfolio in relation to relevant tertiary education such as design/art courses.

KC’s Media Communications Club programme is a programme for students to participate in as a co-curricular activity (CCA) in schools, which is aligned with the MOE’s Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation and Service (LEAPS) framework to acquire relevant skills, express creativity, cultivate entrepreneurship and community spirit.
