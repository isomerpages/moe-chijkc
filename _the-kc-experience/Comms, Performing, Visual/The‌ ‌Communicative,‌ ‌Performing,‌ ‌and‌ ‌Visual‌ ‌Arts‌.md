### The‌ ‌Communicative,‌ ‌Performing,‌ ‌and‌ ‌Visual‌ ‌Arts‌

The Communicative, Performing, and Visual Arts (CPVA) programme is the niche of CHIJ Katong Convent.

As early as the 1950s, the Infant Jesus Sisters saw the arts as a creative outlet for their students. Since then, every principal in KC has built on the same vision, adding their mark, expanding and affirming the school’s commitment to the arts as a means to foster creativity, empathy and reflection, as well as to develop strong language and communication skills. The arts and its ethos is a special grace given to Katong Convent and her students to enable each individual to grow in her God-given uniqueness to live out our motto of “Simple in Virtue and Steadfast in Duty”. KC’s evolving arts education and pedagogy has been encapsulated in her robust arts heritage and strengths in communication, performance, and the visual arts.

It is Katong Convent’s continued commitment to nurture in her students 21st Century Competencies and CCE 2021 and develop a passion for the arts through the CPVA programme. The school adopts the E3 approach as a developmental means to provide quality experience for all (Experience), deepen the learning of an identified segment of the student population through enriched experiences (Enrich) and extend the learning of high progress learners by availing challenging opportunities (Extend).

KC is home to a variety of niched experiences, especially for passionate and talented students. Students may be extended and developed through the Enhanced Art and Drama Elective Instructional Programmes at upper secondary or in one of the performing arts co-curricular activities the school has to offer.
