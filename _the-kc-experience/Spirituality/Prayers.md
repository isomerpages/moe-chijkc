where I ought to go.
<br>Give me courage to do the right thing especially when it is difficult.
<br>Give me justice, always to be fair in thought, word and action, never
to be content when anyone is being unjustly treated.
<br>Give me self-control, always to have my impulses, passions and emotions
under control, never to be swept away into doing things for which I would
be sorry, never to do anything which hurt others, grieve those who love
me or bring hardship to myself. Hear this prayer for your love’s sake.
Amen.</p>

<p>O God, I thank you for my success.

and trained me and who encouraged me when I was tired and discouraged.
Help me not to sit back and be complacent but help me to see that there
are still greater heights to climb, and still further goals to reach. Whatever
praise I receive, help me to always be my own greatest critic. Amen.</p>

<p>O God be with me in my time of difficulty. You know how disappointed I
have been this time. The things that I set my heart on were not for me.
The friends I trusted proved untrue.
<br>I honestly tried so hard, and I failed.
<br>Help me O God to accept things as they are. Help me not to waste my time
on vain regrets and unhappy memories. Give me strength to begin again and
to persevere. Help me to always look forward and not back. Help me to forget
the things that are behind and ever to press forward to things which are
ahead. Amen.</p>
