under control, never to be swept away into doing things for which I would
be sorry, never to do anything which hurt others, grieve those who love
me or bring hardship to myself. Hear this prayer for your love’s sake.

and trained me and who encouraged me when I was tired and discouraged.
Help me not to sit back and be complacent but help me to see that there
are still greater heights to climb, and still further goals to reach. Whatever

<p>Help me O God to accept things as they are. Help me not to waste my time
on vain regrets and unhappy memories. Give me strength to begin again and
to persevere. Help me to always look forward and not back. Help me to forget
the things that are behind and ever to press forward to things which are
ahead. Amen.</p>
