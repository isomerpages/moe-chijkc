<p>CHIJ Katong Convent’s spirituality programme offers a suite of contemplative
practices as a means to ground and centre each individual regardless of
his or her faith. To develop communion, connection, and awareness with
ourselves, each other, and God, the school makes room for contemplative
practice: moments where all may focus on either stillness, or generative
practice as a means to grow in peace with the rest of the KC family.</p>
<p>Morning reflection is a daily occurrence in KC, with students and staff,
regardless of faith, coming forward to share their experience and learning
with the rest of the school. Sharing reflections not only cultivates compassion
but also teaches our students to be discerning citizens of the world, guided
by what is morally and ethically right.</p>
<p>The KC family strives to constantly connect all members to build a safe
space for contemplation, strengthening and healing. Be it the monthly Masses
attended by parents and students, the termly Spirituality Programme where
students reflect on being mindful community members, or in Character and
Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons where the class shares on topics such
as harmony and rising to meet challenges, space is made for the school
community to connect with themselves, each other, and God.</p>
<p>Blessed Barrè and his reflections provide inspiration to the teachers
to embrace the key tenets, which undergird our being and becoming. With
our continued prayers, KC strives to grow in the same steadfast spirit
of service and love which gave Blessed Barrè his vision some four hundred
years ago.</p>
