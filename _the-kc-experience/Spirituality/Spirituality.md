CHIJ Katong Convent’s spirituality programme offers a suite of contemplative practices as a means to ground and centre each individual regardless of his or her faith. To develop communion, connection, and awareness with ourselves, each other, and God, the school makes room for contemplative practice: moments where all may focus on either stillness or generative practice as a means to grow in peace with the rest of the KC family.

Morning reflection is a daily occurrence in KC, with students and staff, regardless of faith, coming forward to share their experience and learning with the rest of the school. Sharing reflections not only cultivates compassion but also teaches our students to be discerning citizens of the world, guided by what is morally and ethically right.

The KC family strives to constantly connect all members to build a safe space for contemplation, strengthening and healing. Be it the monthly Masses attended by parents and students, the termly Spirituality Programme where students reflect on being mindful community members, or in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons where the class shares on topics such as harmony and rising to meet challenges, space is made for the school community to connect with themselves, each other, and God.

Blessed Barrè and his reflections provide inspiration to the teachers to embrace the key tenets, which undergird our being and becoming. With our continued prayers, KC strives to grow in the same steadfast spirit of service and love which gave Blessed Barrè his vision some four hundred years ago.

#### Spirituality in Katong Convent

CHIJ (Katong Convent) strives not just for excellence in the academics, sports and arts, but believes in the development of the heart, soul and mind of every child that passes through the gates of KC. It believes in inculcating strong moral character based on Christian values and principles.

The spirituality programme forms the umbrella for 5 key areas in the school’s spiritual activities:

(1) Religious Education (RE) pull-out sessions for Catholic girls / Reflection sessions for non-Catholic girls<br>
(2) Eucharistic Celebrations (Masses)<br>
(3) Prayer Services<br>
(4) Retreats<br>
(5) Sec 1 weekly Connect programme (for Sec 1 Catholic students only)

The spirituality programme falls under the main responsibility of the School Chaplaincy Team (SCT). The Catholic teachers play an important role in ensuring that Catholic students receive a holistic spiritual education in the school through its programmes, activities and formal lessons, in alignment with the Catholic churches’ vision for its Catholic mission schools.
