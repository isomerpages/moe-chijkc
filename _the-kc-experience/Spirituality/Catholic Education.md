<p>KC’s Catholic identity and ethos exist in everyday school life and provide
guidance to our Catholic students as they seek for the things that can
give them meaning and purpose in living a God-centred life. The spirituality
programme for Catholic students encompasses the following activities:</p>
<p>1 . Morning reflection and prayer</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In addition to the daily morning reflection to help students gain insights
into values and virtues, prayers are said to start the day of learning
centering on God.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2 . Religious Education (RE) pull-out sessions for Catholic girls / Reflection
sessions for non-Catholic girls</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>RE sessions have a scripture-focussed lens and are conducted by the Catholic
teachers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3 . Eucharistic Celebrations (Masses)</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Masses are celebrated monthly (where possible) and according to the liturgical
calendar. The school believes that in national or school celebrations,
we have much to thank God for and know the need to continue to ask for
His blessings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4 . Prayer Services</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Catholic students are invited to attend weekly prayer sessions in the
Chapel to instill a sense of eternity through the need to connect themselves
with God. These sessions are led by the Catholic Support Leaders and held
on Wednesdays from 7:15-7:25am.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5 . Retreats</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Conducted during the school holidays to deepen faith and camaraderie.
Retreats may be conducted by the Catholic teachers or by external Catholic
trainers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>6 . Catholic Connect programme</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Weekly programme to establish a Catholic student community rooted in faith
through fellowship and being immersed in the Gospel. This is led by members
of the Young Christian Student Movement and facilitated by the Catholic
Support Leaders and parent volunteers. Sessions are held every Thursday
from 7:45-8:45am.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Catholic education programme falls under the main responsibility of
the School Chaplaincy Team (SCT). The Catholic teachers play an important
role in ensuring that Catholic students receive a holistic spiritual education
in the school through its programmes, activities and formal lessons, in
alignment with the Catholic churches’ vision for its Catholic mission schools.</p>
