KC’s Catholic identity and ethos exist in everyday school life and provide guidance to our Catholic students as they seek for the things that can give them meaning and purpose in living a God-centred life. The spirituality programme for Catholic students encompasses the following activities:

1 . Morning reflection and prayer
* In addition to the daily morning reflection to help students gain insights into values and virtues, prayers are said at the end of each reflection to start the day of learning centering on God.

2 . Religious Education (RE) pull-out sessions for Catholic girls / Reflection sessions for non-Catholic girls
* RE sessions have a scripture-focussed lens and are conducted by the Catholic teachers 

3 . Eucharistic Celebrations (Masses)
* Masses are celebrated monthly (where possible) and according to the liturgical calendar. The school believes that in national or school celebrations, we have much to thank God for and know the need to continue to ask for His blessings.

4 . Prayer Services
* Catholic students are invited to attend weekly prayer sessions in the Chapel to instill a sense of eternity through the need to connect themselves with God. These sessions are led by the Catholic Support Leaders.

5 . Retreats
* Full-day programme during the school holidays to deepen faith and camaraderie. Retreats may be conducted by the Catholic teachers or by external Catholic trainers.

6 . Sec 1 Catholic Connect programme
* Weekly programme to establish a Catholic student community rooted in faith through fellowship and being immersed in the Gospel. This is led by parent volunteers.

The Catholic education programme falls under the main responsibility of the School Chaplaincy Team (SCT). The Catholic teachers play an important role in ensuring that Catholic students receive a holistic spiritual education in the school through its programmes, activities and formal lessons, in alignment with the Catholic churches’ vision for its Catholic mission schools.
