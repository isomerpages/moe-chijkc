## Catholic Education

KC’s Catholic identity and ethos exist in everyday school life and provide guidance to our Catholic students as they seek for the things that can truly give them meaning and purpose in living a God-centred life. Reflection and prayers are shared at the end of each morning assembly to start the day of learning on a reflective note for all students and teachers. Catholic students attend pull-out programmes with a scripture-focussed lens conducted by the Catholic teachers which creates a community of faith. The celebration of mass according to the liturgical calendar is a key feature in KC’s Catholic education.
