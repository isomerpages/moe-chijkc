<p><strong>The hymns and songs sung in school serve as powerful expressions of our IJ identity and faith. They remind us of our Catholic roots, nurture our relationship with God, and strengthen our sense of belonging to the IJ family. Through these shared songs of praise and gratitude, we celebrate our heritage, deepen our faith, and grow in love, hope, and service to others.</strong>

<p><strong>Hymn to Father Barré</strong>
<br>
<br><strong>French Version</strong> 
<br>De vos enfants, exaucez la priére
<br>Veillez sur nous O Saint Pére Barré
<br>Choisissez-vous un essaim d’ouvrières
<br>Par le Seigneur à votre attirée
<br>Dans L’institut, conservez d’âge en âge
<br>Un zèle ardent, l’humilité, la foi
<br>Le pur amour, la force et le courage
<br>Pour observe à jamais votre loi (2x)
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>English Version </strong>
<br>O hear our prayer, most holy Father Barré
<br>We are your children, watch o’er us we pray
<br>Touch many hearts to follow in your footsteps
<br>To dedicate their lives to youth and poor
<br>Drawn by the Lord to make Christ known and loved
<br>Fill us with zeal, humility and faith
<br>Pure love and strength and courage without fear
<br>To keep your spirit alive in our hearts (2x)</p>

<p><strong>IJ Songs (from Share the Love)</strong>
<br>
<br><strong>Caritas, Share the Love</strong>
<br>
<br>Eyes speaking of an endless grief
<br>Lips open in a wordless cry
<br>Let’s share the love we take for granted
<br>Try to keep their last hopes alive
<br>
<br>Hands reaching for their loved ones lost
<br>Hearts holding to a flickering dream
<br>Let’s share the love we waste away
<br>Show them that the world truly cares
<br>
<br>Caritas share the love that
<br>they are missing inside
<br>Caritas let’s take the step
<br>to reach out to the other side
<br>There’s so much to give if we dare
<br>To the lost &amp; forgotten out there
<br>Caritas, share the love, share the love
<br>
<br>Smiles breaking through
<br>those hardened faces
<br>A gift to us that makes us whole
<br>Let’s share the peace
<br>our maker gave us
<br>Making all our souls feel alive</p>

<p><strong>One Family</strong>
<br>
<br>Does it really matter what we call ourselves
<br>As long as he’s the one who first called us
<br>Why spend all our time fighting amongst ourselves
<br>When he called us to spread his love?
<br>Remember his message to us
<br>
<br><strong><em>Chorus</em></strong>
<br>We are one family in the Lord
<br>That’s how it’s meant to be, in the Lord
<br>Working hand in hand
<br>To make him known throughout the world
<br>So let’s just stop and face each other
<br>It’s like looking in a mirror
<br>Recognize our similarities
<br>Yes it’s time to come together
<br>We can make things even better
<br>Try to be what he meant us to be
<br>One family
<br>
<br>Does it really matter how we pray or sing
<br>As long as it’s his name on our lips
<br>Just enjoy the way he made us
<br>to be different but the same
<br>Cos he made us to be like him</p>

<p><strong>These Hands He Made</strong>
<br>
<br>These hands he made, for love not hate
<br>These hands he made, to act not wait
<br>These hands can save us from a cruel fate
<br>These hands he made, These hands he made
<br>
<br>These hands he made, can dry your tears
<br>These hands he made, can calm your fears
<br>These hands can reach across two thousand years
<br>These hands he made, These hands he made
<br>
<br>Hands reaching out to me
<br>Hands reaching to be free
<br>Hands shouldn’t be alone
<br>Hands together, love is sown
<br>These hands he made, to join in prayer
<br>These hands he made, to show we care
<br>These hands can build our dreams if we dare
<br>These hands he made, These hands he made</p>
