## Enhanced Art Programme

The Enhanced Art Programme is an MOE supported special Art programme conducted within Katong Convent for upper secondary students offering the ‘O’ Level Art subject. Beyond the regular general art programme for upper secondary, students in the EAP are provided opportunities to participate in activities with other EAP schools in Singapore to enrich their passion and learning in visual art.
