## Enhanced Art Programme (EAP)

The Enhanced Art Programme is an MOE-supported special Art programme conducted within Katong Convent for students offering Art at upper secondary levels. Beyond the regular general art programme for upper secondary, students are provided unique enrichment opportunities such as artist workshops and learning journeys. There may also be opportunities to participate in activities with other EAP schools in Singapore to enrich their passion and learning in visual art.

More information on the KC Art Programme and EAP can be found on the Art Department page [here](https://www.chijkatongconvent.moe.edu.sg/learning/departments/art). Additionally, we invite you to visit our [KC EAP website](https://chijkceap.com/) where we celebrate past work and
alumni of the programme.
