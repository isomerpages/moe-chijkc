**Option B**<br>  
During **school hours**, the Chromebook only allows an iCON account to sign into the device. An iCON  account is a student account that is an email address ending with **@students.edu.sg** 

To avoid activity logging, content filtering protection, and to enable the installation of Chrome  applications/extensions, the child/ward should **sign out of the iCON account after school hours / during holiday period**. 

After school hours / during holiday period, the login screen has an additional option to sign in.
Student is to click on "**Add person**" to add their person Google Account and sign in. This will allow usage without the DMA restrictions.
