**Option B**<br>  
During&nbsp;**school hours**, the Chromebook only allows an iCON account to sign into the device. An iCON&nbsp; account is a student account that is an email address ending with&nbsp;**@students.edu.sg**&nbsp;

To avoid activity logging, content filtering protection, and to enable the installation of Chrome&nbsp; applications/extensions, the child/ward should&nbsp;**sign out of the iCON account after school hours / during holiday period**.&nbsp;

After school hours, the login screen has an additional option to sign in as a guest user. Student can use their person Google Account and sign in. This will allow usage without the DMA restrictions.
