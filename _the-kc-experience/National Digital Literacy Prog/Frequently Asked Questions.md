<p>2 . <strong>What considerations does the school have in selecting the Chromebook as the choice of device? Is there an option to a different device with a top-up?</strong>
<br>The Chromebook is the prescribed device bundle for the school.</p>
<p>Our curriculum and technological plans leverage learning activities via
Google Suite and Google Classroom. The provisioning of Student iCON will
enable students to learn via their Google account. Most of the other tools
are also accessible by Chrome browser online and do not require installation
or high computing power.</p>
<p>We therefore narrowed our choice to Chromebook, which operates on Chrome
browser and is auto updated. It also has a fast boot time and long battery
life that can allow teachers to manage the blended learning in the classroom
as students switch from learning activities without the Chromebooks&nbsp;to
those that require it.</p>
<p>The selected Chromebook suits the learning needs of our students as it
is not overpowered and offers less distractions to teaching and learning.
It is an affordable device for the profile of all KC students and helps
to establish a common-device environment to support the students and teachers
more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Purchase of Device</strong>
</p>
<p>3 . <strong>How do&nbsp;we&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;the&nbsp;device&nbsp;through&nbsp;the&nbsp;school?</strong>
<br>Parents with Singpass can indicate your consent for the purchase of the
device through the school at this link: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/edusaveformsgso" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/edusaveformsgso</a>
<br>A copy of the letter for procurement is available to parents without SingPass.
Kindly make your request to the General Office.</p>
<p>4 . <strong>How do we check the amount of Edusave fund available in our child's/ward's (for Singapore Citizen) account?</strong> 
<br>You can call 6260 0777 (24-hours automated hotline) to check your child's/ward's
Edusave balance.</p>
<p>5 . <strong>Can we use Edusave to purchase a different laptop model on our own?</strong> 
<br>No, Edusave funds can only be used for the chosen model facilitated by
the school through MOE's bulk tender.</p>
<p>6 . <strong>How can I apply for financial assistance for the purchase of the PLD?</strong>
<br>Each student will receive a personalised bill which reflects the subsidy
that matches her financial situation, if applicable. MOE FAS do not need
to apply for subsidy.</p>
<p>Other Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and International Students
who require financial assistance and meet the income criteria of Gross
Household Income (GHI) $4,400 or less, or Per Capita Income (PCI) $1,100
or less, may apply for financial assistance through the General Office.</p>
<p>If you are recently retrenched, please produce a “Letter of Retrenchment”
from your company. When assessing GHI and PCI of needy International Students,
parent’s income refers to the income of parents who may be residing overseas,
not the local guardian’s income. Electronic signatures are acceptable in
the application if the parents are residing overseas.</p>
<p>7 . <strong>Can my child/ward not purchase the device?</strong> 
<br>Every student is required to have a device for teaching and learning purposes
and is encouraged to purchase one through the school via MOE’s bulk tender.</p>
<p>8 . <strong>Can we use our existing device or purchase our own?</strong>
<br>Students can only use Chromebook (running on ChromeOS) as their PLD in
the school to be installed with Device Management Application (DMA) software
to provide a safe learning experience for the child/ward. Besides preventing
misuse of the PLD, the uniformity of PLDs in a class would ensure a smooth
learning experience for all. The PLD purchased through the school will
come with the necessary warranty and insurance as well. Parents who choose
to opt out of this bulk purchase will be informed to have your child/ward
bring the <strong>*</strong>existing device (<strong>*ONLY Chromebook is allowed</strong>)
to school for suitability assessment. Parents can have their child/ward
bring the existing Chromebook to school for an assessment on the suitability
between <strong>8 to 10 Jan 2025</strong>.
<br>
<br>We highly recommend that the existing Chromebook should support the following:
<br>
<br>- 11.6 inch and above display [to avoid eyestrain]
<br>- Intel N100 and above Processor [for sufficient processing speed]
<br>- 8GB of RAM [for quick access to computing resources]
<br>- 64GB of Storage space
<br>- Stylus support (Student will be required to annotate and draw on the
PLD)
<br>- Battery must be able to hold the charge for 10 hours, for lessons and
after school-hours (CCA time)
<br>- Able to receive Google Auto Update at least till 2030</p>
<p>We would like to highlight that if the student-owned device is assessed
to be unsuitable, parents/guardians are strongly encouraged to give their
consent at this link <a href="https://go.gov.sg/edusaveformsgso" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/edusaveformsgso</a> to
procure the school chosen device.</p>
<p>9 . <strong>Can students who require help with funding get a 2nd hand device?</strong>
<br>Every student is encouraged to purchase a device through the school via
the MOE Device Bulk Tender.
<br>All Singaporean students are supported by MOE in purchasing a device.
Students may approach the school if they require financial assistance.</p>
<p>10 . <strong>Do I need to purchase 2 devices if I have 2 children/wards studying in the school?</strong> 
<br>Yes, each child/ward would need to have her own learning device in school
daily and for learning after school, hence it might not be practical to
share the device with their siblings.</p>
<p>11 . <strong>What is DMA and how does it provide a safe learning experience for my child to prevent misuse of the device?</strong>
<br>The DMA can:</p>
<p>a . Remotely deploy teaching and learning applications as well as security
patches
<br>b . Restrict apps and websites accessibility, as well as screen time during
specified hours</p>
<p>There will be default setting on web content filtering decided by the
school for students to focus on learning in a safe and conducive online
environment. Certain Chrome apps or extensions will also be installed to
support teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Following school hours, the PLD will come under the DMA settings from
6.30 am to 2.00 pm.</p>
<p>Parents can choose from three options of control over DMA past 2.00 pm:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Keep to the Default settings: the Chromebook will follow the same DMA
settings set by the school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option A: Parents can exercise control by adjusting the screen time or
restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option B: Disable the DMA entirely and manage your child’s use of the
Chromebook entirely on your own. This would mean that you are not using
the DMA to limit screen time, monitor usage activities or control the installation
of any apps.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>12 . <strong>For personal devices approved by the school, will the DMA be installed?</strong>
<br>All PLDs must be installed with the DMA before they can be used in school.
Students who do not wish&nbsp;to purchase a device because they already
have their own device will have to seek approval from the school before
they can pursue this option.</p>
<p>The school will ascertain whether the specifications of their existing
device are on par with the school’s chosen device model. Upon approval,
the school will assist to install the DMA in the student’s existing device,
which can be uninstalled from the device upon the student’s graduation.</p>
<p><strong>Software and Apps Installation</strong>
</p>
<p>13 .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What software will be loaded onto the device?</strong>
<br>To&nbsp;support&nbsp;the&nbsp;development&nbsp;of&nbsp;digital&nbsp;literacies,&nbsp;MOE&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;rolling&nbsp;out&nbsp;the&nbsp;following&nbsp;applications&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;PLDs&nbsp;progressively
after Student iCON rollout: Google Suite for Education, Microsoft Office
productivity suite which includes only Word. Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote
&amp; Publisher.</p>
<p>14 .&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Will an antivirus programme be installed in the device?</strong>
<br>The Chromebook does not come with an antivirus programme as the Google
Chrome OS has a range of security features to protect users from falling
victim to malware, viruses and other threats. In addition, all updates
and security patches for the device will be managed backend by MOE / school
and pushed down remotely via the DMA.</p>
<p>15 . <strong>Is it possible to use the Chromebook apps offline?</strong>
<br>Chromebook can, if necessary, be set up to work without internet access.
Using the Chromebook offline will create some limitations to the usage
of the apps, especially for collaborative work.</p>
<p>Students from low-income households will continue to be supported for
subsidized broadband under IMDA’s digital access schemes. More information
on IMDA’s digital access schemes can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/digital-access-at-home?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=2025_dfl&amp;utm_content=dfl_cmd_sem&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23068783165&amp;gbraid=0AAAAApIXgxRWHTgQl4CYW7Sw6ezgHFuLZ&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw3tzHBhBREiwAlMJoUh6K3qRUCyNXNf8bobqV338LjtCiIuebygm1cz9k1FF19P6TwtQ_YhoCfmEQAvD_BwE" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DigitalAccess@Home</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Device</strong>
</p>
<p>16 . <strong>Where&nbsp;do&nbsp;we&nbsp;collect&nbsp;the&nbsp;device&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;purchase?</strong>
<br>The school will make arrangement for students to collect their devices
in the school.</p>
<p>17 . <strong>When will the girls get their PLD?</strong>
<br>The PLDs are projected to be delivered in March 2025.</p>
<p>18 .&nbsp;<strong>Will the school let the child know what to look out for when collecting the PLD?</strong>
<br>A briefing will be conducted for all students on the PLDs. Students will
learn more about their PLDs in this briefing.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Device</strong>
</p>
<p>19 .<strong>Will&nbsp;having a Chromebook&nbsp;replace&nbsp;textbooks?</strong>
<br>The Chromebook will not replace textbooks, as textbooks are currently
designed as curriculum-aligned reference. Students can use the Chromebook
to complement learning from textbooks with access to curriculum-aligned
resources in the SLS.</p>
<p>20 .&nbsp;<strong>Are students expected to bring their PLDs to school daily?&nbsp;What&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;expected weight&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;device?</strong>
<br>The students should bring a fully charged PLD to school daily. &nbsp;This
is part of school-wide learning routines. Lockers are available for rental
if students wish to store their books in school. As we are creating a Blended
Learning environment for learning to take place anywhere, anytime, online,
offline, the students would need to bring their device to school daily
to benefit from this enhanced learning environment.</p>
<p>MOE&nbsp;has&nbsp;considered&nbsp;factors&nbsp;such&nbsp;as&nbsp;size&nbsp;and&nbsp;weight&nbsp;of&nbsp;devices&nbsp;when&nbsp;preparing&nbsp;the&nbsp;tender&nbsp;specifications&nbsp;for&nbsp;the
Bulk&nbsp;Tender. The&nbsp;size&nbsp;of&nbsp;our&nbsp;school’s&nbsp;chosen
device is&nbsp;12.2" and&nbsp;its weight&nbsp;is&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;kg.</p>
<p>21 . <strong>Will there be a pool of devices to be loaned to students should there be a situation where their devices malfunction?</strong>
<br>The school will provide devices for short-term loan due to loss or repairs,
subject to the availability of devices available for loan.</p>
<p>22 . <strong>If my child/ward forgets to bring the PLD to school, can she still catch up with the lesson which may be conducted online in class?</strong>
<br>Students will be reminded to bring their devices as part of her daily
learning routine. For emergency cases, as assessed and recommended by teachers,
a device may be loaned to her for that day, subject to the availability
of devices available for loan.</p>
<p>23 .&nbsp;<strong>Are there plans to avail power outlets for charging in school /during class?</strong>
<br>Charging facilities will be available in the school library. This is only
for emergency use as students are expected to be responsible for charging
their PLD the night before and bringing a fully-charged PLD to school the
next day.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty and Repair</strong>
</p>
<p>24 . <strong>If the device becomes faulty or requires change in parts, does the school do the repair or should students/parents resolve that themselves?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Technical support will be provided to students through:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service-desk set up in school during breaks and after school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lenovo Service Center, located at 2 Kallang Avenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acer Service Center, located at International Business Park.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>25 . <strong>Who will bear the cost of repair?</strong>
<br>If the device is damaged, the parents/student can report it to the school.
The school will coordinate with the vendor on the assessment of damage
and repairs. If there are additional cost, the vendor will contact the
parents/student before proceeding with the repair. All additional cost
for repairs will be borne by the parents/students if not covered by insurance.</p>
<p>Edusave funds cannot be used to pay for the cost of repairs.</p>
<p>If the device is damaged beyond economical repair and is not covered by
insurance (coverage against damage and loss/theft), the replacement device
will have to be paid for by the parents/student.</p>
<p>26 . <strong>What if the student loses the device?</strong>
<br>The PLD is bundled with 3-year insurance and 3-year warranty, which allows
for two repairs or one replacement.</p>
<p>The insurance coverage is only applicable to situations of damage and
loss where the student has taken precautions to safeguard the device. A
police report will have to be made for the insurance claim. Accidental
loss due to negligence is not covered by insurance and a new PLD will have
to be purchased by the parents/student. The school will assist in purchasing
a replacement PLD.</p>
<p>27 . <strong>Since the warranty/insurance covers 3 years, what is the arrangement beyond 3 years?</strong>
<br>The insurance and warranty bundled in the school-purchased device covers
3 years. If the&nbsp;insurance/warranty has expired, or the replacement
is not covered under the insurance/warranty (e.g.&nbsp;due to negligence,
student has already received a replacement device earlier), school can
help to facilitate the second&nbsp;&nbsp;purchase. &nbsp;Students can use
their Edusave to pay for a new device and lower-income family can apply
for&nbsp;subsidy.</p>
<p>Extended warranty beyond 3 years for the computing device is not available
in the open market. It would be very costly to incorporate such a requirement
and it makes more economical sense to replace the device when it is beyond
economical repair after 3 years.</p>
<p>28 . <strong>What happens to the device ownership upon graduation?</strong>
<br>The Chromebook bundle deal entitles parents/student the ownership of the
device and accessories. Chromebook runs on Chrome OS and will continue
to be updated to the latest version of Chrome&nbsp;whenever available if
the default auto-update settings are kept. The Chromebook will continue
to be updated beyond its warranty of 3 years.</p>
