## National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)

The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready. Under the NDLP, MOE announced that every student will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by end-2021.

Please find the briefing slides on NDLP during the Sec One Parents Engagement Webinar held on 18 Jan [here ](/files/KC%20PLD%20Briefing%20to%20Parents%2018%20Jan_website.pdf) **(please click)**

#### NDLP @ CHIJ Katong Convent

In alignment with our CHIJ Katong Convent’s desired graduate outcomes, we seek to leverage this PLD initiative to develop our students to be

*   **Compassionate Servant Leaders** _who demonstrate respect for self, others and reaches out in service to those in need_
*   **Innovative Problem Solvers** _who think from different perspectives to generate alternative solutions to manage learning with confidence online_   
*   **Discerning Citizens of the World** _who navigate the cyber world with integrity and discernment_  
*   **Effective Communicators** _who connect with others in meaningful online relationships to co-construct knowledge_

#### Blended Learning @ CHIJ Katong Convent 

Blended learning is a mix of home-based and in-school activities that taps both online and offline approaches to learning. Blended Learning takes place during school days and independent learning days.

As KC embarks on _Blended Learning_, our students will be using the PLDs for:

*   active learning in all subjects
*   learning tasks that require research, digital creation, and collaborative learning
*   self-directed learning and to enhance their personal productivity with applications like calendaring and note-taking.

#### Personal Learning Device @ CHIJ Katong Convent

CHIJ Katong Convent has short-listed the Chromebook as the PLD for our students. For us, as with many schools, the key considerations informing our choice of the device are rooted in the affordance for classroom teaching and learning across all subjects and the accessibility it provides to students.  We are striving for a common-device environment to support the students and teachers more effectively.

The Chromebook is a device which is not overpowered and offers less distractions to learning. It is also an affordable device for all KC students. Its multi-touch HD display with a 360-degree hinge enables our students to use it like a tablet or laptop. Coupled with the stylus, students will be able to use it for notetaking, sketching, and working out complex math problems by hand.

If your child/ward is a Singapore citizen, you can use your child’s/ward’s Edusave to pay partly or fully for the PLD. For families who have financial concerns, you may refer to the section below on “Financial Assistance”.<br>
