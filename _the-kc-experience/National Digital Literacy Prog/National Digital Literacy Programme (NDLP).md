## National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)

The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready. Under the NDLP, MOE announced that every student will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by end-2021.
