Book and Music Week (BMW) is Katong Convent’s signature arts programme. Initiated more than 40 years ago, it is an annual tradition celebrated, loved, and fondly remembered by each cohort of girls who passes through the gates of Katong Convent. As a festival that forges the identity of each KC girl and bonds students within classes, across levels, and together as one community, every BMW encourages us KC girls to step out of our comfort zone, step up to its challenges and onto the proscenium stage.

This year, we looked at the stories of women over time through the themes of

*   Reclamation - recovering the untold stories of women’s impact in history

*   Appreciation - paying tribute to the women who have enabled us to be where we are today as a nation, as a school; and honouring the wonder women in our individual everyday lives – mothers, grandmothers, sisters, godmothers, aunties, or female caregivers who have impacted us

*   Aspiration – imagining the possibilities for women in the future and aspiring to what we are capable for ourselves
