<h4>Wednesday to Friday, 17 - 19 July 2019</h4>
<p>Book and Music Week (BMW) is Katong Convent’s signature arts programme.
Initiated more than 40 years ago, it is an annual tradition celebrated,
loved, and fondly remembered by each cohort of girls who passes through
the gates of Katong Convent. As a festival that forges the identity of
each KC girl and bonds students within classes, across levels, and together
as one community, every BMW encourages us KC girls to step out of our comfort
zone, step up to its challenges and onto the proscenium stage.</p>
<p>This year, we looked at the stories of women over time through the themes
of</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reclamation - recovering the untold stories of women’s impact in history</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciation - paying tribute to the women who have enabled us to be where
we are today as a nation, as a school; and honouring the wonder women in
our individual everyday lives – mothers, grandmothers, sisters, godmothers,
aunties, or female caregivers who have impacted us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aspiration – imagining the possibilities for women in the future and aspiring
to what we are capable for ourselves</p>
</li>
</ul>
