Book and Music Week (BMW) is Katong Conventâ€™s signature arts programme. Initiated in 1974, it is an annual tradition that celebrates literature and the arts as an exploration and extension of classroom learning which sees Katong Convent girls given the chance to shine with their God-given talents, regardless of their CCA. All students are given the chance to be involved in the making, presenting, responding, and curating of the variety of art forms and experiences that the festival has to offer. Founded by Mrs Marie Bong, former Principal of Katong Convent, BMW is a much-loved tradition in Katong Convent that is spoken of fondly by all who have lived and breathed the BMW experience as a student here.
