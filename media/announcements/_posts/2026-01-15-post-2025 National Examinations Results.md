<p>Our Principal, Mrs Tan, reminded students that national examinations are
only one of many milestones in life. For every student, there are pathways
forward, and we remain committed to supporting each girl as she takes her
next confident step.</p>
<p>We come together in gratitude for the village behind each student — parents,
guardians, family members, teachers, and friends — whose quiet dedication
and steadfast presence have sustained our girls throughout the years.</p>
<p>As students look ahead to new chapters, we encourage them to carry with
them the values they have cultivated and the lessons they have learned.
May they continue to grow into Women of Purpose, simple in virtue and steadfast
in duty, and remain connected to the KC spirit wherever they go. Congratulations
once again!</p>
