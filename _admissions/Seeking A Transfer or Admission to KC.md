## Seeking A Transfer/Admission to KC

SC/SPR students who are studying in MOE secondary schools and wish to be considered for admission to CHIJ Katong Convent could submit a transfer application (not on first-come-first-serve) to the school for consideration.

As vacancies are limited, the school will contact you via phone or email when there is a vacancy for your daughter/ward.

**How do I apply?**  <br>
Application is to be done strictly via this [**link**](https://go.gov.sg/kc-transfer-2023). <br>
Please note that only short-listed applicants will be notified to submit documents (for eg. applicant's BC, parents'/guardian's NRICs etc) for verification.

**For clarification**  <br>
Should you have any general queries, please contact the General Office at Tel: 6448 6433 during office hours or email to [chijktcs@moe.edu.sg](mailto:chijktcs@moe.edu.sg) (indicate in the subject header “School Transfer”).
