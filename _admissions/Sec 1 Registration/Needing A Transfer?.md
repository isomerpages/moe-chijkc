#### Seeking a Transfer Out

Parents / Guardians who wish to transfer their daughter / ward out of CHIJ Katong Convent based on medical ground may appeal under Medical Appeal Exercise. All applications must be accompanied with the relevant supporting documents.

MOE will assist parents/guardians in finding a school with the appropriate resources. The transfer is subject to available vacancies in the school. You may wish to refer to Reference F of the S1 Information Booklet for the list of schools with special needs facilities.

For students who have been accepted by other schools, please email a copy of the school’s acceptance form to [chijktcs@moe.edu.sg](mailto:chijktcs@moe.edu.sg) for processing of the student’s withdrawal
