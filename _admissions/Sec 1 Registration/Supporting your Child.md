## 5\. Supporting your Child

#### i. Counselling Needs

**a. What is counselling?**

Counselling is a collaborative helping process where the school counsellor and student explore the student’s challenges with a focus on feelings, thoughts and their behaviour. This process is aimed at guiding students to develop a better understanding of themselves and insights into the issues they face, with the hope of positive change. A relationship of trust between the counsellor and student forms the foundation for effective counselling to take place.

**b. Who is counselling for?**

The life of a student can be a stressful one. Students who are facing personal challenges and issues such as these can choose to approach the school counsellor for help: 

*   Relationship and interpersonal issues
*   Academic stress
*   Personal issues 
*   Coping and problem-solving 
*   Decision-making

**c. Who do I approach if I have queries or concerns related to counselling for my child/ ward?**

*   Form teachers
*   School counsellors:

#### iii. After School Engagement

The After School Engagement (ASE) is targeted for students who might not have after school supervision (i.e., both working parents without extended support in caring for the child). The ASE is a student-centred hub where students engage in a structured after-school programme within the school environment, extending the culture of care beyond school hours. 

In ASE, students are supervised to complete their homework, engage in meaningful social interactions, learn leadership skills as well as participate in meaningful activities such as sports, craft, community work or even learning journeys.

The ASE will operate on non-CCA days (Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays). The operating hours are from 2:45 p.m. – 5:30 p.m.

As part of the daily ASE schedule, students complete their homework/studies during the first hour. After which, they will be engaged in an activity planned for them by the ASE teachers in charge. Most activities will be held within the school compound. Parents will be informed in advance if activities are to be conducted out of school.

If you are keen to sign your child/ward up for the ASE please fill in the form using this [link](https://go.gov.sg/kc-ase-2022) **FORM NOT AVAILABLE**.

If you have any other queries about ASE, please contact Mrs Algena Lim ([koh_jiun_algena_louisa@moe.edu.sg](mailto:koh_jiun_algena_louisa@moe.edu.sg)).
