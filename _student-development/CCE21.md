<h4><strong>Our Goal</strong></h4>
<p>CHIJ Katong Convent is dedicated to providing every student with a holistic
education, while nurturing values-driven, principled, and compassionate
individuals who actively contribute to society. Through the Character and
Citizenship Education (CCE) programme, CHIJ Katong Convent focuses on fostering
the moral development of its students by guiding them to internalise and
uphold values that inform their decision-making and shape their behaviour
and attitudes towards themselves, others, and the environment.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Programme Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>The CCE programme in CHIJ Katong Convent is guided by MOE’s Character
and Citizenship CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame as well as our school and IJ
values.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame</strong>
</p>
<p>CCE 2021 provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development

<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Future readiness and&nbsp;</p>

<p>The curriculum content of CCE (Figure 1) is based on the three big ideas

<p>There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality.
These include CCE Lessons during curriculum time, Key Student Development
Experiences (SDEs) beyond the classroom such as during school events and
programmes, school-based initiatives, teachable moments during other subject
lessons, and learning opportunities beyond school.</p>

<br><strong>Underpinned by IJ and KC Values</strong>
</p>
<p>At CHIJ Katong Convent, the school's core values of <em>Perseverance, Integrity, Excellence and Resilience</em> form
the essential foundation upon which our students aspire to fulfil the vision
of a KC Graduate — individuals who are compassionate servant leaders, innovative
problem solvers, discerning citizens of the world, and effective communicators.
In living out the school’s mission, each KC Graduate is called to uphold
and promote the enduring IJ principles of truth, justice, freedom, and
love.</p>
<p>This holistic framework (Figure 3) not only seeks to achieve MOE’s desired
outcomes of education but also aims to equip our students with critical
21st-century skills, ensuring they are well-prepared to navigate an increasingly
complex and interconnected world as responsible and impactful citizens.</p>
