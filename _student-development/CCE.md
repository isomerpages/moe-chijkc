<h4><strong>Our Goal</strong></h4>
<p>CHIJ Katong Convent is dedicated to providing every student with a holistic
education, while nurturing values-driven, principled, and compassionate
individuals who actively contribute to society. Through the Character and
Citizenship Education (CCE) programme, CHIJ Katong Convent focuses on fostering
the moral development of its students by guiding them to internalise and
uphold values that inform their decision-making and shape their behaviour
and attitudes towards themselves, others, and the environment.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Programme Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>The CCE programme in CHIJ Katong Convent is guided by MOE’s Character
and Citizenship CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame as well as our school and IJ
values.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame</strong>
</p>
<p>CCE 2021 provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development
of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions
in a coherent and holistic way.</p>
<p>CCE 2021 aims to develop in our students</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Good character</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resilience and social-emotional well-being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future readiness and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active citizenship</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The curriculum content of CCE (Figure 1) is based on the three big ideas
of Identity, Relationships, and Choices, and comprises the teaching and
learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus
on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are
taught and applied in the following Curriculum Content Areas:</p>

</p>
<p>There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality.
These include CCE Lessons during curriculum time, Key Student Development
Experiences (SDEs) beyond the classroom such as during school events and
programmes, school-based initiatives, teachable moments during other subject
lessons, and learning opportunities beyond school.</p>
<p>a) CCE lessons (incorporating National Education, Cyberwellness, Education
and Career Guidance, Sexuality Education, Mental Health and Family Education)</p>

<li>
<p>The overarching goal of the CCE programme is to nurture a person of integrity
who acts responsibly with the welfare and interests of others in need.
It aims to help our students acquire skills to recognise and manage emotions,
develop care and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish
positive relationships and handle challenging situations effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CCE lessons are conducted on a weekly basis in class by Form Teachers,
using student- centric teaching strategies to explicitly teach values and
social and emotional competencies as well as to equip students with knowledge
and skills to better understand real-world contexts, through discussions
on contemporary issues.</p>

<br><strong>Underpinned by IJ and KC Values</strong>
</p>
<p>At CHIJ Katong Convent, the school's core values of <em>Perseverance, Integrity, Excellence and Resilience</em> form
the essential foundation upon which our students aspire to fulfil the vision
of a KC Graduate — individuals who are compassionate servant leaders, innovative
problem solvers, discerning citizens of the world, and effective communicators.
In living out the school’s mission, each KC Graduate is called to uphold
and promote the enduring IJ principles of truth, justice, freedom, and
love.</p>
<p>This holistic framework (Figure 3) not only seeks to achieve MOE’s desired
outcomes of education but also aims to equip our students with critical
21st-century skills, ensuring they are well-prepared to navigate an increasingly
complex and interconnected world as responsible and impactful citizens.</p>
