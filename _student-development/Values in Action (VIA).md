<p>VIA focusses on developing character and acquiring values through service
to the school and the community. VIA experiences enables KC students to
live out core values such as empathy, compassion, service and resilience;
hone skills such as organisation and communication and strengthen civic
responsibility and emotional connection to the community.</p>
<p>In CHIJ Katong Convent, the VIA focus, experience and development for
Sec 1 to 5 is progressive – focusing on self, school and the local community
in lower secondary and extending towards the wider community and nation
in upper secondary.</p>
<p>These VIA activities can be organised at the individual, class or CCA
level. They are particularly encouraged to initiate their own VIA opportunities
whereby on their own accord, they identify specific needs of the community
partner or beneficiary and then follow on to plan and implement VIA activities
to meet those needs. Such student-initiated activities allow students to
hone leadership and organisational skills, in addition to developing them
to be compassionate servant leaders.</p>
