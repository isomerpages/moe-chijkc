**Who is eligible**

Students who:

*   Are Singapore Citizens.
*   Attend government or government-aided schools.
*   Have a monthly gross household income of $2,750 or less, or a monthly per capita income of $690 or less.

**Difference between Gross Household Income (GHI) and Per Capita Income (PCI)**

To calculate PCI, divide the monthly gross household income by the number of people living in the same household. This allows students from larger families to benefit from the scheme.

**How it works**

Under MOE FAS, your child will receive:

*   A full subsidy of $5 per month for school fees.
*   A full subsidy of $10 per month for standard miscellaneous fees.
*   Free textbooks and school attire.
*   $15 transport credit per month if your child takes public transport.
*   A $2.90 per meal subsidy for school meals, applicable to 10 meals per school week.

**How to apply**

You can download the MOE FAS application form or collect a copy at your child’s school. Submit the completed form with all the relevant documents directly to the school.

If you have children in different government or government-aided schools, you can submit 1 application form to any of their schools. The school that receives the application form will inform you of the outcome.
