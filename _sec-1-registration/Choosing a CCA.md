## 7 \. Choosing a CCA

#### Guidelines for Secondary Ones

KC’s Co-Curricular Programme aims to uncover each student’s talents, develop their potential, build character and help them to cultivate a lifelong interest in recreation, leading to a balanced life in adulthood.

#### CCA Policy

CCA participation is compulsory for all students in MOE secondary schools.

Every student must participate in ONE core CCA.

Students are strongly encouraged to remain in the same CCA for the complete school year and participation has to be continuous throughout the course of secondary school education.

Under the LEAPS (2.0) grading system, points are awarded for leadership, achievement, participation and service.

Details of the grading system and the school’s CCA policy are spelt out clearly in the Student Journal.

#### CCAs Trials & Auditions

The objective is to help identify the talent in our students and develop their potential to the fullest.

Students are strongly encouraged to attend all four dates reserved for trials/ auditions, on the 11, 13, 18 and 25 January 2023, and they should try out CCAs from at least three of the four different categories (Uniformed Groups, Sports and Games, Performing Arts and Clubs and Societies).

Details on the trial/auditions for each of the CCAs will be displayed in the foyer by Mon, 9 January 2023

#### Selection Criteria

*   Medically fit and have no long-term illnesses or conditions that will prevent them from participating in physical activities.
*   Physically fit to participate fully in the training drills and activities during the trials.
*   Each Sports CCA has its own distinct guidelines; please clarify with the teachers in charge of the respective CCAs.

Students must be able to attend school holiday and/ or weekend activities at certain points of the year (all).

#### Selection of CCAs

All Secondary One students will be required to go online to select a CCA of their choice. They will be asked to make five choices and the school will allocate students according to their talents as well as their preferences.  Please take note that the school will endeavour to allocate a student to one of her five choices.

Once a Secondary One student has been allocated a particular CCA, she must participate in that CCA for the whole of her first year. She can only request for a change of CCA in the first month of Secondary Two.

The timeline of the Sec One CCA Allocation Exercise can be found in the sections below.

Should there be an instance where a student does not get any of the five choices she made (due to the quota allocated to each CCA), special arrangements will be made and she will be advised personally by the teachers in-charge of CCA registration.

#### CCA Attendance

Please note that while CCA in primary school is optional, CCA in secondary school is compulsory and students’ attendance <u>must be regular.</u> The school views absence from CCA without a valid reason as truancy, which is a serious offence. 

Students with attendance less than 75% for each term (without a valid reason) will receive a “Fair” for conduct in their report book.

#### Frequency and Timing of CCAs

CCAs are held on Wednesdays and Fridays after school. All CCAs will end by 6:00 p.m.

Sports & Games and Performing Arts CCAs will generally hold sessions twice a week while Uniformed Groups, Clubs and Societies (except for Debate), once a week.

Please note that students taking some Higher Mother Tongue classes will have their language lessons in another school and these may clash with the designated CCA days. They are thus advised to select a CCA that does not clash with these lessons.

#### CCAs Offered

CCAs offered fall into four core categories:

*   Sports & Games
*   Uniformed Groups
*   Performing Arts Groups

#### Tips for students in their selection of CCAs

If you have done well in a CCA in primary school, you may consider carrying on with it in secondary school to hone your skills further, especially if it is in the area of sports and the performing arts.

Choose a CCA which interests you; something you will enjoy doing and one which will help you develop as a balanced individual.

If possible, choose a CCA which you have an aptitude for.

Do not be influenced by your friends as you may not enjoy doing what your friends enjoy.

Be open to learning something new and discover your hidden talents if you do not get your first or second choice.
