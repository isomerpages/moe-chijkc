## Welcome

Welcome to CHIJ Katong Convent. We are pleased that you have chosen us for your secondary school education.

An autonomous school that has been conferred the School Distinction Award, CHIJ Katong Convent provides girls with a holistic education, encompassing innovative but rigorous academic and co-curricular programmes. As a Catholic mission school, we are guided by the IJ values of truth, justice, freedom and love, and the IJ Motto, ‘Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty’ to provide an environment for the child to grow in her unique giftedness.

Our vision of ‘A Caring School that Excels’ has inspired staff and students to strive for excellence in all that we do. This translates to value-adding to academic potential, inculcating strong moral values and nurturing all-round confident and gracious young ladies with integrity, hearts of compassion and a strong sense of duty and social responsibility.

Guided by our steadfast belief in character formation and the need to equip students with the essential competencies for the 21st&nbsp;century, we aim to develop our graduates to be compassionate servant leaders, innovative problem solvers, discerning citizens of the world as well as effective communicators. Indeed, for 91 years, we are proud to have nurtured our girls to be women of distinction who are able to make their mark in their respective fields.

Unlike previous years, where we welcomed you and your parents on Registration Day, we will not do so this year in keeping with the safe management measures during this pandemic. We would like to invite you and your parents to take time to read through the essential information we have posted on this page so that you can make adequate preparations for your first day at CHIJ Katong Convent and a new chapter in your schooling journey!

To help you navigate the information on our website to ensure a smooth start for your 4/5 years with us, the following segments which you and your parents will find in the website are sequenced according to priority of action to be taken:
