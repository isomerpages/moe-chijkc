**Lastest Update (12 July 2023)**

With effect from **20 July 2023**, students will be able to perform a password reset on their own with the Student Self-Service Password Reset function in the MOE Identity Management System (**MIMS**) Portal.

Students will be required to perform a one-time set up of answers to challenge questions in their MIMS Portal to enable student self-service password reset when required.

Please refer to this file for the steps to set up the answers to challenge questions in the MIMS Portal.
