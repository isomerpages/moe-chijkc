<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T) education in KC aims to nurture in our
students a way of thinking and doing – designerly dispositions which are
inherent in design practices – through designing and making. The designerly
dispositions are defined as:</p>
<p>1 . Embracing uncertainties and complexities.</p>
<p>2 . Being cognisant of and resolving real-world, ill-defined problems.</p>
<p>3 . Having a relentless drive to seek out how things work.</p>
<p>4 . Engaging the use of doodling and sketching, and 3D manipulation of
resistant materials as a language for visualisation, communication and
presentation.</p>
<h4>Lower Sec Programme</h4>
<p>Our lower secondary D&amp;T programme emphasises the following:</p>
<p>1 . Thinking through sketching to generate and to develop design solutions.</p>
<p>2 . Exploration and experimentation of ideas through mock-ups to allow
students to seek a practical and appropriate design solutions.</p>
<p>3 . The making of prototypes as a cognitive and hands-on endeavour.</p>
