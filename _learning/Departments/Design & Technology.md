#### Goals

Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T) education in KC aims to nurture in our students a way of thinking and doing – designerly dispositions which are inherent in design practices – through designing and making. The designerly dispositions are defined as:

1 \.  Embracing uncertainties and complexities.

2 \.  Being cognisant of and resolving real-world, ill-defined problems.

3 \.  Having a relentless drive to seek out how things work.

4 \.  Engaging the use of doodling and sketching, and 3D manipulation of resistant materials as a language for visualisation, communication and presentation.

#### Lower Sec Programme

Our lower secondary D&T programme emphasises the following:

1 \.  Thinking through sketching to generate and to develop design solutions.

2 \.  Exploration and experimentation of ideas through mock-ups to allow students to seek a practical and appropriate design solutions.

3 \.  The making of prototypes as a cognitive and hands-on endeavour.

#### Signature Programme
