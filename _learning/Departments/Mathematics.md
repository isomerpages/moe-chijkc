<p>The Mathematics Programme seeks to foster interest in Mathematics and
develop thinking, reasoning, communication, modelling and metacognitive
skills through mathematical problem solving. The understanding of big ideas
in Mathematics brings about greater coherence and connections across different
topics, strands and levels. Real-world applications and technology integration
help students to see mathematics as a powerful tool for understanding and
solving authentic problems.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary Programme builds a strong mathematical foundation
via engaging learning experiences in number sense, algebraic manipulation,
geometry and data handling. Through cohort-wide mathematical challenges
and competitions, students develop resilience and confidence while discovering
the joy of mathematical problem solving.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Upper Secondary Programme extends and deepens mathematical knowledge
in algebra, geometry and statistics through key learning experiences that
emphasize analytical thinking, precision, and the application of mathematics
to real-world contexts, laying a strong foundation for post-secondary education.</p>
