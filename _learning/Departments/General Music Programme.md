**Lower Secondary**

The GMP offered to lower secondary students provides opportunities for students to listen, sing, play and express themselves musically. The objectives of the GMP are:  
  
*   to develop an awareness and appreciation of music in local and global cultures
*   to develop the ability for creative expression and communication through music
*   to provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music.

With guidance from the music teachers, students will learn to listen, watch, imitate, create sounds and actions, and eventually, demonstrate their creativity in being able to compose, improvise and perform individually and collaboratively.

In addition, all lower secondary students will learn the basic skills of playing and creating music using the keyboard, individually as well as in a mini-ensemble.
