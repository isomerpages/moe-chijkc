<p><strong>Lower Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>The KC Lower Secondary General Music Programme at KC fosters personal
and collaborative musical growth and provides opportunities for students
to listen, sing, play and express themselves musically. The objectives
of the GMP are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>to develop an awareness and appreciation of music in local and global
cultures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to develop the ability for creative expression and communication through
music</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement
in music.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With guidance from the music teachers, students will learn to listen,
watch, imitate, create sounds and actions, and eventually, demonstrate
their creativity in being able to compose, improvise and perform individually
and collaboratively.</p>
<p>In Secondary 1, students explore their musical identity through rhythm,
voice, and Orff instruments in the module "Music and the Self," culminating
in a short solo performance integrating singing and percussion. They also
examine cultural influences through global and local folk music before
creating and performing a short piece reflecting their cultural identity
and original pop songs about self-expression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Secondary 2, students deepen their collaborative skills in "Music with
Others," starting with improvisation duets and progressing to ensemble
performances using a range of instruments. The programme culminates with
students performing a jazz ensemble piece that integrates improvisation,
allowing them to experience both individual expression and group collaboration
in the jazz tradition.</p>
