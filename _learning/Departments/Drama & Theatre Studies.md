<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>Drama at KC: Foundation for Creative, Confident, and Collaborative Learners</p>
<p>At Katong Convent, our Drama Programme is anchored in the Lower Secondary
Drama Foundation Programme (DFP), where students are introduced to the
fundamentals of drama through exploration, collaboration, and play.</p>
<p>In DFP, students engage in embodied learning that develops their physical
and vocal expression, critical thinking, and imaginative response. They
learn to respond to stimuli, devise performances, and negotiate ideas within
an ensemble. Through these creative processes, students build the confidence
to present themselves effectively and the empathy to work meaningfully
with others.</p>
<p>More than a foundation in drama, the programme cultivates vital 21st Century
Competencies and Social Emotional Learning. Students strengthen their communication,
collaboration, and creative thinking skills while developing self-awareness,
responsible decision-making, and respect for diverse perspectives. These
competencies are nurtured through hands-on, process-driven experiences
that balance the domains of making, presenting, and respondingâ€”ensuring
that KC Drama students grow to be more than performers: as thoughtful,
articulate, and compassionate individuals.</p>
