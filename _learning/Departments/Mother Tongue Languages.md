lesson activities, we provide comprehensive support to nurture students'
enthusiasm in their language learning journey. Our experienced teachers

<p><strong>MTL Activities and Events</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1) Festive Celebrations</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lunar New Year Celebrations</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The school ushered in the Year of the Snake with vibrant festivities that
brought our entire school community together. The celebrations began with
an exciting interclass decoration competition, where students transformed
their classrooms into festive spaces with creative Chinese New Year-themed
decorations. Our Secondary 2 to 5 students also showcased their digital
creativity by producing heartwarming video greetings for the KC family.</p>
<p>The celebration day was marked by warmth and tradition, as classes gathered
for reunion parties while our Upper Secondary students demonstrated their
values of service and respect by hosting both our dedicated school support
staff and elderly guests from Goodlife! The highlight of the day was a
spectacular concert featuring performances by the Mother Tongue Languages
department, Chinese Orchestra, Concert Band, and Chinese Drama Club.</p>
<p>Adding to the festive atmosphere, the dynamic Lion Dance performance captivated
the audience, while the beloved Labubu mascot delighted everyone with a
playful candy shower. In keeping with KC tradition, the celebration concluded
meaningfully with class representatives presenting mandarin oranges to
their teachers – a gesture symbolising respect and good fortune.
<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hari Raya Celebrations</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Malay Language Unit transformed the school into a festive celebration
of Hari Raya Aidilfitri through an enchanting array of cultural activities.
The celebration weaved together tradition and contemporary expression,
creating memorable experiences for our entire school community.</p>
<p>Malay Language students engaged in the meaningful tradition of crafting
personalised Hari Raya greeting cards, while deepening their cultural understanding
by sharing with the entire school their insights about the spiritual significance
of Ramadan and the joyous celebration of Hari Raya. The highlight of our
festivities was the highly anticipated KC Hari Raya music video – a creative
collaboration between our talented Malay Language students and teachers.
This signature production not only spread festive cheer throughout the
school but also beautifully captured the essence of our community spirit
and cultural heritage.
<br>
</p>
<p>Through these festive celebrations, we not only preserve cherished traditions
but also foster a deeper appreciation of Chinese and Malay culture among
our diverse student body, embodying the inclusive spirit and bonds that
CHIJ Katong Convent holds dear.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2）Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Fortnight, a key initiative by the Ministry
of Education, serves as a vibrant platform that extends language learning
beyond conventional classroom boundaries. This immersive programme creates
dynamic opportunities for students to engage with their Mother Tongue Languages
in authentic and meaningful contexts. Through a carefully curated series
of cultural activities and interactive experiences, students are immersed
in an environment that naturally encourages the practical application of
their Mother Tongue.</p>
<p>During Term 1 of 2025, our students immersed themselves in an enriching
MTL Fortnight filled with diverse cultural experiences. The programme featured
hands-on traditional art workshops where our Chinese Language students
explored the intricate techniques of Chinese calligraphy and the delicate
artistry of fan painting. Adding a contemporary touch, students engaged
in lively interactive sessions with popular YES 933 Radio DJs, who shared
insights into Chinese media and broadcasting. The programme was further
enriched by memorable performances from renowned local Xinyao (新谣) buskers,
who brought Singapore's unique Chinese musical heritage to life. The cultural
immersion culminated in an educational journey to the Singapore Chinese
Cultural Centre, where students deepened their understanding of Chinese
heritage in the local context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our Malay Language students embarked on an inspiring journey
of appreciating Malay traditions and culture with the theme "Tracing Our
Heritage, Preserving Our Culture". This carefully chosen focus illuminates
the vital importance of Singapore's Malay heritage, specifically highlighting
the historical landmarks and sites that have shaped our Malay community's
identity. Through an engaging tapestry of activities spanning two weeks,
students were empowered to discover, appreciate, and take pride in their
Malay cultural legacy. A signature of this year's programme was our specially
curated learning journey for Secondary 4 and 5 students. This immersive
experience took students through the heart of Singapore's Malay cultural
district, where they explored the storied streets of Kampong Glam, the
vibrant Arab Street, and the majestic Sultan Mosque. These historic sites
serve as living classrooms, offering students unique insights into the
Malay community's enduring influence on Singapore's multicultural fabric.</p>
<p>Beyond the MTL Fortnight, it is our hope that students will continue to
embrace and apply their Mother Tongue Languages and cultural knowledge
in their daily lives, keeping the spirit of our heritage alive for generations
to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3) Cultural Exposure through Drama&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>We endeavour to bridge the gap between our students’ language learning
and cultural appreciation by bringing professional performances directly
to our students. The Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) ("文化随意门"计划),
an initiative by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning, enriches
our students' cultural literacy through exposure to high-calibre Chinese
theatrical productions. In 2025, our students will have the privilege of
experiencing 'Partial Eclipse of the Heart' (《逆光》), an engaging production
by the renowned local theatre company, The Theatre Practice (实践剧场).</p>
<p>Similarly, to deepen students’ appreciation of the Malay Language and
culture, a theatre outing was arranged for our Secondary 4 and 5 students
in 2024 to watch the performance Bawang Putih Bawang Merah. This experience
not only exposed students to the richness of Malay storytelling traditions
but also aimed to spark greater interest and love for learning the language
beyond the classroom.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>4) Literary Publications</strong>
</p>
<p>Every year, the MTL department launches a fresh edition of our signature
Chinese and Malay literary publications – <em>《淡墨清香》</em>, as well as <em>Karya &amp; Coretan</em>,
which feature dynamic showcases of students’ creativity and innovation. <em>《淡墨清香》</em>captures
a repertoire of articles compiled from students’ exemplary essays, creative
writing competition, as well as reflections from student activities. <em>Karya &amp; Coretan</em> features
a diverse collection including essays, emails, poetry, digital posters,
and infographics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In both publications, each piece of work reflects the unique voices, perspectives,
and talents of students across all levels and streams, and is a celebration
of their imagination, critical thinking and literacy. Through this platform,
we aim to empower our students to express themselves boldly, explore new
ideas, and leave their mark on an ever-evolving creative landscape.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>5) Sec 1 Higher Chinese Language Learning Journey to Jewel Changi Airport</strong>
</p>
<p>In April, our Secondary 1 Higher Chinese students stepped beyond their
textbooks to experience Jewel Changi Airport firsthand, bringing their
classroom learning to life. This innovative learning journey transformed
Singapore's iconic landmark into an immersive Chinese language classroom.</p>
<p>Through carefully designed tasks, students explored the magnificent Rain
Vortex, verdant Canopy Park, and vibrant retail spaces while honing their
Chinese language skills. They engaged in authentic writing exercises inspired
by their multi-sensory experiences, bridging the gap between academic learning
and real-world application.</p>
<p>This experiential learning approach not only deepened students' understanding
of their textbook material but also kindled their enthusiasm for Chinese
language learning. By connecting classroom concepts with tangible experiences,
students discovered that language learning extends far beyond traditional
boundaries, enriching their appreciation for both Chinese language and
Singapore's architectural marvels.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Participation in External Competitions</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In the MTL Department, we recognise that excellence often begins with
a single moment of opportunity. We actively seek out diverse external platforms
that challenge our students to push beyond their comfort zones and showcase
their linguistic talents. By carefully curating these enriching experiences,
we empower our students to discover new strengths, develop confidence in
their mother tongue, and transform their potential into commendable achievements.
Our commitment goes beyond academic excellence; we aim to nurture confident
communicators and cultural ambassadors who will carry forward their linguistic
heritage with pride and purpose.</p>
