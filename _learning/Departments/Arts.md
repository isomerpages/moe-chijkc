#### Our Goals

In Katong Convent, we believe Art is essential in equipping students for the 21CC while developing them holistically for life. Our aim is to give our students both a visual and verbal language through which they can communicate effectively in life. Through our Art curriculum, we hope to imbue in our students the necessary artistic dispositions to enable them to be comfortable with ambiguity, have a capacity for idea generation and be equipped for investigative research, life skills applicable beyond an artistic context.

#### Lower Sec General Art Programme

Our lower secondary Art curriculum aims to equip our students with essential visual literacy skills and cultural awareness to enable them to learn and communicate visually, and to engage with society culturally. The curriculum also ensures a good foundation for students with a passion in Art who may aspire to continue their practice in the upper secondary level. The key pedagogy we use to engage our students in lower secondary is ‘Play’, where we hope to inspire in them curiosity and a keen sense of observation for the world around them.

#### Upper Sec General Art Programme

Our upper secondary curriculum comprises Studio Practice and Study of Visual Arts. The creation of artworks and the critical appraisal of artists and artworks are two modes of learning that we believe are central to a balanced art education. These components provide students with diverse learning experiences and skills in visual literacy. Undergirded by our belief in using the Inquiry-Based Learning approach in the teaching of upper secondary art, we seek to impart the necessary artistic dispositions in our students to enable them to flourish in their artistic endeavours in their next institute of learning.

_Studio Practice_<br>
Studio Practice engages students in the creation of artworks. Students hone their observation skills, learn to discriminate visual qualities and give form to their ideas and experiences when they are engaged in art making. It provides opportunities for students to acquire a working understanding of artistic processes and develop competency in manipulating various art media for self-expression, with opportunities to explore a good range of media and experiment with different techniques in their studio practice.

_Study of Visual Arts_<br>
The Study of Visual Arts reinforces the critical learning experiences in Studio Practice. The awareness and critical appraisal of artists and artworks in the context which artworks are made allow students to experience and engage with the visual arts in greater breadth. The Study of Visual Arts emphasises the development of critical thinking skills and provides students with the opportunities to respond to and discover insights from artists/ artworks. Augmented by learning experiences to art institutions, engagements with artists and immersion in geographical spaces, the Study of Visual Arts can inculcate in students greater appreciation for the visual arts and their role in society.

#### Enhanced Art Programme (EAP)

The Enhanced Art Programme is an MOE-supported special Art programme which distinguishes the upper sec art curriculum in nine selected schools across Singapore. In Katong Convent, upper secondary students offering art enjoy the privilege of being in an EAP school in the unique way we deliver our programme. Beyond the regular general art programme for upper secondary, we include enrichment opportunities, such as artist workshops and learning journeys, which our students participate in over their Sec 3 &amp; Sec 4 years. This may include opportunities to participate in activities with students from other EAP schools.

As one of the first four schools accorded with EAP status in Singapore, we celebrated 10 years of EAP in Katong Convent in 2021 with the launch of an online KC EAP art exhibition site. We proudly invite you to visit the link below to enjoy a special curation of artworks by past EAP students.
