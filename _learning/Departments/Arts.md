<h4>Our Goals</h4>
<p>In Katong Convent, we believe Art is essential in equipping students for
the 21CC while developing them holistically for life. Our aim is to give
our students both a visual and verbal language through which they can communicate
effectively in life. Through our Art curriculum, we hope to imbue in our
students the necessary artistic dispositions to enable them to be comfortable
with ambiguity, have a capacity for idea generation and be equipped for
investigative research, life skills applicable beyond an artistic context.</p>
<h4>Lower Sec General Art Programme</h4>
<p>Our lower secondary Art curriculum aims to equip our students with essential
visual literacy skills and cultural awareness to enable them to learn and
communicate visually, and to engage with society culturally. The curriculum
also ensures a good foundation for students with a passion in Art who may
aspire to continue their practice in the upper secondary level. The key
pedagogy we use to engage our students in lower secondary is ‘Play’, where
we hope to inspire in them curiosity and a keen sense of observation for
the world around them.</p>
<h4>Upper Sec General Art Programme</h4>
<p>From 2025, our upper secondary curriculum will adopt the new national
syllabus for O-Level / G3 Art. The creation of artworks, as well as viewing,
thinking and talking about the work of others, continue to be modes of
learning we believe are central to a balanced art education. Undergirded
by our belief in using the Inquiry-Based Learning approach, we seek to
impart our upper secondary Art students with the skills, knowledge and
dispositions needed to flourish in their artistic endeavours in and beyond
KC.</p>
<p>Learning takes place through cycles of process, product and discourse,
encouraging the testing and refinement of each student’s own ideas and
outcomes. Through the curriculum, students will experience a range of art
media including 2D, 3D and time-based mediums, and explore both fine art
and design. Their artistic practice will be honed, supported and affirmed
through feedback and critique, as well as exposure to the work of both
peers and contemporary artists alike.</p>
<p>Ultimately, each student’s learning will culminate in the assembly and
curation of their own portfolio of work. This body of work should come
to represent their journey as student artists, and is both a commemoration
and celebration of their artistic growth.</p>

<h4>Enhanced Art Programme (EAP)</h4>
<p>The Enhanced Art Programme is an MOE-supported special Art programme which
distinguishes the upper sec art curriculum in nine selected schools across
Singapore. In Katong Convent, upper secondary students offering art enjoy
the privilege of being in an EAP school in the unique way we deliver our
programme. Beyond the regular general art programme for upper secondary,
we include enrichment opportunities, such as artist workshops and learning
journeys, which our students participate in over their Sec 3 &amp; Sec
4 years. This may include opportunities to participate in activities with
students from other EAP schools.</p>
<h4>Development Initiative for Visual Art (DIVA)</h4>
<p>DIVA is a mentoring approach for our DSA Visual Art students. Through
DIVA, we aim to groom leaders in Visual Art through our 3 ‘E’ approach
of Expose, Enrich and Extend, where our students get to experience both
the depth and the breadth of learning in Visual Art.</p>
