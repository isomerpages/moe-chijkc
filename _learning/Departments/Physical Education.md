## Physical Education

#### Goals

The PE department at Katong Convent believes that physical education is a vital component of studentsâ€™ educational experience, and good physical health is essential to a fulfilling life. Thus, here at KC, we aim to provide our students with a well-rounded physical education, and imbue in them knowledge of and a love for health and physical activity, coupled with enriching outdoor experiences, to help them embark on a journey of lifelong physical activity.

Through our PE lessons, we also strive to teach the importance of self-management, respect for others, resilience, and effective teamwork, in order to develop both independent learners as well as team players.

To achieve these objectives, we follow the MOE Physical Education Syllabus (2014) closely and conduct physical education lessons twice a week for all students. We focus on the three main learning areas:

*   Physical Activities
*   Outdoor Education
*   Physical Health and Fitness

#### Lower Sec Programme

By the end of their 4 or 5 years with us, our students would have been exposed to three categories of games: territorial, striking/fielding and net/ barrier games.

Our lower secondary school students are taught the games of handball (Secondary 1) and football (Secondary 2) in Term 2 and 3, culminating in an Inter-Class Games Carnival with classes of the same level, in Term 4 after the End-of-Year Examinations.

For Outdoor Education, they are taught how to identify potential hazards in an environment and basic first aid skills, including the administration of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and use of the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). The Secondary One students are also taught some basic tent pitching and outdoor cooking skills, in preparation for their Outdoor Adventure Camp the following year.

#### Upper Sec Programme

Our upper secondary school students are taught the games of softball (Secondary 3), volleyball (Secondary 4) and touch rugby (Secondary 5) in Term 2 and 3, culminating in an Inter-Class Games Carnival with classes of the same level, in Term 4 after the End-of-Year Examinations.

For Outdoor Education, they are taught navigational skills using a map and a compass. More components of basic first aid are also taught to the students, including reinforcement of how to carry out CPR and the usage of the AED.
