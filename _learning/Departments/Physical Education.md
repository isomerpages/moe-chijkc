<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>The PE department at Katong Convent believes that physical education is
a vital component of students’ educational experience, and good physical
health is essential to a fulfilling life. Thus, here at KC, we aim to provide
our students with a well-rounded physical education, and imbue in them
knowledge of and a love for health and physical activity, coupled with
enriching outdoor experiences, to help them embark on a journey of lifelong
physical activity.</p>
<p>Through our PE lessons, we also strive to teach the importance of self-management,
respect for others, resilience, and effective teamwork, in order to develop
both independent learners as well as team players.</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives, we follow the MOE Physical Education Syllabus
(2024) closely and conduct physical education lessons twice a week for
all students. We focus on the three main learning areas:</p>

</ul>
<h4>Lower Sec Programme</h4>
<p>By the end of their 4 or 5 years with us, our students would have been
exposed to three categories of games: territorial, striking/fielding and
net/ barrier games.</p>
<p>Our lower secondary school students are taught the games of handball (Secondary
1) and football (Secondary 2) in Term 2 and 3, culminating in an Inter-Class
Games Carnival with classes of the same level, in Term 4 after the End-of-Year
Examinations.</p>
<p>For Outdoor Education, they are taught how to identify potential hazards
in an environment and basic first aid skills, including the administration
of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and use of the Automated External
Defibrillator (AED). The Secondary One students are also taught some basic
tent pitching and outdoor cooking skills, in preparation for their Outdoor
Adventure Camp the following year.</p>
<h4>Upper Sec Programme</h4>
<p>Our upper secondary school students are taught the games of softball (Secondary
3), volleyball (Secondary 4) and badminton (Secondary 5) in Term 2 and
3, culminating in an Inter-Class Games Carnival with classes of the same
level, in Term 4 after the End-of-Year Examinations.</p>
<p>For Outdoor Education, they are taught navigational skills using a map
and a compass. More components of basic first aid are also taught to the
students, including reinforcement of how to carry out CPR and the usage
of the AED.</p>
