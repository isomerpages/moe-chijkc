<h4>Overview of the English Language Programme</h4>
<p>Taking reference from the EL Syllabus 2020, the KC English Language&nbsp;Programme
aims to develop effective and affective language use in students&nbsp;through
exposure, empowerment, and enactment opportunities, nurturing&nbsp;students
to become:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Discerning &amp; Critical Readers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inquirers &amp; Meaning Makers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empathetic &amp; Convincing Communicators</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lower Secondary EL Programme</h4>
<p>The lower secondary programme is designed to deepen student’s speaking,&nbsp;writing,
reading and listening skills in the English language, through a critical&nbsp;exploration
and appreciation of a wide variety of multi modal, literary and&nbsp;informational
texts. Students are also guided to understand and respond to&nbsp;purposes,
audiences, contexts and cultures.</p>
<h4>Upper Secondary EL Programme</h4>
<p>The upper secondary programme further deepens students’ affective and
effective language use and sharpens their receptive and productive language
skills, so that they are able to communicate with self-expression, a sense
of social awareness and responsibility, and socio-cultural sensitivity.</p>
<h4>Overview of the Literature Programme</h4>
<p>The KC Literature Programme consists of a lower secondary exposure programme
with the option for students to offer the discipline as either a full or
elective subject at the O levels.</p>
<p>In Katong Convent, we approach literature as a skills-based discipline
that facilitates the development of empathy and perspective. Students are
equipped with the aesthetic and intellectual skills necessary to appreciate,
analyse and interpret a text independently, and respond critically and
coherently. Through immersion in a range of local and canonical works,
students develop an understanding of the human condition and the role of
their own values, beliefs and biases. Students are also trained to think
like a writer, a pedagogical approach to literature that utilises creative
writing as a means to develop an understanding of, and sensitivity to,
writer’s craft.</p>
<h4>Lower Secondary Literature Foundation Programme</h4>
<p>Through this comprehensive programme designed to entice and make accessible
a completely new subject, students are introduced to the fundamentals of
literary analysis through the close reading of bite-size unseen texts before
progressing to longer, full-length work. Over the course of two years,
students will be exposed to local and foreign poetry, speculative fiction,
and the Shakespearean play.</p>
<h4>Upper Secondary Literature Programme</h4>
<p>The upper secondary programme deepens students’ critical appreciation
to the artistic decisions of the literary form through a metacognitive
and inquiry-based approach to texts. Students are trained to acknowledge
and consider multiple perspectives whilst developing a greater acceptance
for ambiguity and open-endedness. Students learn to be convincing communicators
of their own interpretations in their active engagement with the text.
Elective students have the opportunity to study local writing and poetry
from different countries. In addition, and in counterpoint to the former,
Full Literature students will also study the Shakespearean text.</p>
<h4>Signature Programmes</h4>
<p>ELL Talent Management - The WOW (Words, Oracy, Writing) Programme</p>
<p>We warmly invite students who have a natural flair and strong interest
in speaking or writing to join our programme. It offers exciting opportunities
to grow their confidence and sharpen their communication skills through
specially designed workshops.</p>
<p>Students passionate about speaking will receive training in effective
communication techniques, including how to engage and manage an audience.
These skills prepare them to take on roles such as master of ceremonies
at various school events, where they can truly shine on stage.</p>
<p>Those who love writing will get the chance to work with established writers
and explore the creative process more deeply. They'll learn how to express
themselves clearly and creatively.</p>
<p>For both speaking and writing, selected students may also have the chance
to represent the school in national or even international competitions—challenging
themselves, gaining valuable experience, and building their confidence
along the way.</p>
