#### Goals

The KC Drama Programme consists of a lower secondary foundation programme and a two-year elective programme that culminates in the O levels.

In Katong Convent, we balance the domains of making, presenting, and responding by steeping our students in both the performance practice and language of creative thinkers. As an Applied Subject, students will learn through hands-on learning experiences such as devising, analysing performances, and communicating their ideas to an audience.

#### Lower Sec

The lower secondary Drama Foundation Programme introduces students to the fundamentals of acting and creating through exploration and play. Students explore physical and vocal skills as they learn how to respond to stimuli and negotiate creative pathways with their ensemble. The lower secondary DFP equips students with the physical expression and critical inquiry to present themselves with confidence.
