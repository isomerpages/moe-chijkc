#### Goals

The KC Drama Programme consists of a lower secondary foundation programme and a two-year elective programme that culminates in the O levels.

In Katong Convent, we balance the domains of making, presenting, and responding by steeping our students in both the performance practice and language of creative thinkers. As an Applied Subject, students will learn through hands-on learning experiences such as devising, analysing performances, and communicating their ideas to an audience.

#### Lower Sec

The lower secondary Drama Foundation Programme introduces students to the fundamentals of acting and creating through exploration and play. Students explore physical and vocal skills as they learn how to respond to stimuli and negotiate creative pathways with their ensemble. The lower secondary DFP equips students with the physical expression and critical inquiry to present themselves with confidence.

#### Upper Sec

The Drama Elective Programme develops studentsâ€™ understanding of Drama through both practical and theoretical study, including the study and analysis of human behaviour through dramatic forms as well as skills development via dramatic presentations. The programme equips students with the skills to create pieces of theatre which, when viewed by the audience, evokes strong feelings as a means to get audiences to consider their message. While searching for their own form of expression, students are exposed to different types of theatre, creative processes, professions and practices in the theatre industry through artist-led masterclasses and performance experiences. Students enrolled in DEP can expect a comprehensive and highly customised programme.

#### Signature Programmes

*   Masterclasses with theatre practioners

#### Mentorship and Development in Drama (MADD) programme

MADD is a mentoring approach for our Direct School Admission (DSA-Sec) Dramatic Arts students. Through MADD, we aim to groom leaders in the dramatic arts through our E3 approach of Exposing, Enriching and Extending our students so that they get to experience both the depth and the breadth of learning in the dramatic arts.

DSA-Sec Dramatic Arts students are enrolled in the CHIJ Katong Convent Arts and Culture arts leadership programme.

For more information on the programme and DSA admission, please refer to our Admissions page.
