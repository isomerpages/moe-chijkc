<p>CHIJ Katong Convent has implemented Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)
from 2023.</p>
<h4>Purpose of Full SBB</h4>
<p>Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning
and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests
of our students. With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school
education where students learn each subject at the level that best caters
to their overall strengths, interests and learning needs. Under Full SBB,
there will no longer be separate Express, N(A), and N(T) streams, and students
will be in mixed form classes where they can interact with peers of different
strengths and interests.</p>
<h4>Full SBB in CHIJ Katong Convent</h4>
<p><strong>Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school has implemented mixed form classes starting from the Secondary <strong>1 cohort of students entering our school in 2023</strong>.</p>
<p>The Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed form classes, comprising
students from different courses of study. Mixed form classes present more
opportunities for students to interact with other students taking different
subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests. In their
mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level,
amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students
in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.</p>
<p>These subjects are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Art</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design and Technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food and Consumer Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical Education</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different
learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.</p>
<p><strong>Offering subjects at a more demanding level </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science</strong>:
Secondary school students can offer these subjects at a more demanding
level from the start of Secondary One based on the students’ PSLE Achievement
Level (AL) for each subject. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students
may also offer these subjects at a more demanding level based on their
performance in secondary school.</p>
<p><strong>Geography, History and English Literature</strong>: From Secondary
2, students will be able to offer these subjects at a more demanding level
if they meet subject-specific criteria. They should also possess positive
attitude towards learning and strong commitment to offer the subject at
a more demanding level.</p>
