<p><strong>About Us</strong>
</p>
<p>We are a group of dedicated parents who firmly believe in building a strong
partnership with the school to enhance our girls’ learning experience.
<br>We aim to serve with humility, compassion, selflessness and enthusiasm,
and be a blessing to others through our volunteer works.
<br>We will serve as a bridge of communication between the school and the
parents, and support the school’s plans and programmes.
<br>We aim to be a support network to the parents and facilitate strong parent/child
bonding experiences.</p>
