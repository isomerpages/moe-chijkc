<p>As the second oldest IJ school in Singapore, Katong Convent (KC) has a
rich heritage of nurturing generations of women who have gone on to make
meaningful contributions to society. Guided by the philosophy of our founder,
Blessed Nicolas Barré, we believe that every child is uniquely gifted and
precious in the eyes of God. This belief continues to shape our mission
of providing a holistic and values-driven education that develops each
girl to her fullest potential.</p>
<p>Our school vision, <em>A Caring School that Excels</em>, reflects our deep
commitment to cultivating a safe and inclusive environment—one where every
student is known, loved, and supported. We strive to build a community
where every KC girl experiences a strong sense of belonging, is empowered
to develop her God-given talents, and is inspired to be a lifelong learner
with the courage and curiosity to embrace the future.</p>
<p>True to our identity as a Convent by the Sea, the PIER values—<strong><u>P</u></strong>erseverance, <strong><u>I</u></strong>ntegrity, <strong><u>E</u></strong>xcellence,
and <strong><u>R</u></strong>espect—together with the IJ values of Truth,
Justice, Freedom and Love, form the moral compass that grounds and guides
our students. Just as a pier provides a place of stability and support,
these values anchor our girls as they navigate the complexities of life
with grace, confidence, and optimism.</p>

<p>In a rapidly evolving world, we are committed to equipping our students
with 21st-century competencies that go beyond academic excellence. Through
diverse learning experiences—particularly in our niche of <strong>Communicative, Performing, and Visual Arts</strong>—KC
girls develop essential skills such as creativity, critical thinking, collaboration,
and empathy. Signature programmes like <em>Book and Music Week</em> offer
platforms for expression, connection, and joy, enriching the girls’ learning
and development.</p>
<p>At the heart of our success is the strong and unwavering support of the
KC Family—our dedicated staff, CHIJ Board members, parents, alumnae, and
community partners. It is through this partnership that we create a nurturing
ecosystem where our students are encouraged, supported, and celebrated.</p>
<p>Together, we work to shape every KC girl into a <strong>Woman of Purpose</strong>—a <strong>Compassionate Servant Leader</strong>,
an <strong>Innovative Problem Solver</strong>, an <strong>Effective Communicator</strong>,
and a <strong>Discerning Citizen of the World</strong>, ready to lead with
heart and serve with conviction.&nbsp;</p>
