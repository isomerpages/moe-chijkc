## Crest & Motto

#### History of the Badge

<img src="/images/badge&motto.jpg" style="width:60%">

This badge or crest was created by IJ pupils in 17th century France incorporating into its concept and design, values and aspirations which they wished to be lived out in each CHIJ School. Their design is still proudly worn by thousands of CHIJ pupils in the 21st century.

This badge is a symbol of the international unity binding together pupils from every continent, especially CHIJ pupils from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Japan.

#### The Design of the CHIJ School Crest

The red shield has a silver band edged in gold. On the right side of the shield is the Book of the Gospels with a silver rosary. On the left is a golden distaff and spindle. The shield surmounted by a gold cross is encircled by a garland of marguerites.

#### The Significance of the Symbols

The shield – red in colour symbolizes the all-embracing message of love.
*   On its right is the open gospel. This points to the source of inspiration which guides the whole school community. The silver rosary represents the story of the gospel as seen through the eyes of the Virgin Mary.
*   On its left are the distaff and spindle. These are symbols of womanly labour, typical of an earlier period, which remind us of the dignity of work and the satisfaction and fulfillment to be found in a task well accomplished.
*   The cross which surmounts the crest serves as a reminder that the source of our inspiration, dedication and fidelity comes from Christ.
*   The shield is encircled by a garland of marguerites. These simple flowers are found by the wayside in France and are symbolic of the purity and simplicity which should characterise our relationships at every level.

#### The CHIJ Motto

This motto is easy to remember but requires a lifetime of practice.

**_Simple in Virtue_**<br>
This translates into the cultivation of a personal honesty that frees us to relate to others with respect, openness and sincerity, and to become disinterested seekers of truth, wisdom and all that is good. It is the core from which we operate.

**_Steadfast in Duty_**<br>
This translates into the strength of character necessary to commit oneself to a goal. It embraces the capacity to rise above the difficulties and obstacles encountered in the execution and completion of any task or duty undertaken in the service of others.

As a Catholic Mission School, the term “virtue” in its spiritual sense is a distinctive character trait or quality inspired and nurtured by a genuine desire to live according to God’s will as revealed in the Gospel.

The term “duty” expresses our response to what we discern to be God’s call to us. Love is therefore the underpinning of a life lived faithfully in the pursuit of these ideals.
