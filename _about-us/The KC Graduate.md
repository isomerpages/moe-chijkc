## The KC Graduate

As part of the schoolâ€™s character development focus, Katong Convent is committed in developing the all-round KC girl.

Each student is being developed in relation to the competencies of the KC Graduate Profile comprising 4 main domains:

*   **Compassionate Servant Leader**
*   **Innovative Problem Solver**
*   **Effective Communicator**
*   **Discerning Citizen of the World**

The attributes in the KC Grad profile form part of the journey in the development of our students. At some juncture of their school life, our students pause, reflect, self-assess and receive feedback from their teachers.
