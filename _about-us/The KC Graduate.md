## The KC Graduate

As part of the school’s character development focus, Katong Convent is committed in developing the all-round KC girl.

Each student is being developed in relation to the competencies of the KC Graduate Profile comprising 4 main domains:

*   **Compassionate Servant Leader**
*   **Innovative Problem Solver**
*   **Effective Communicator**
