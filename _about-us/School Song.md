Forward Katong Convent<br>
Make our future bright<br>
To achieve our aims<br>
Bravely we will fight<br>
Guide us in our labours<br>
To the Lord we pray<br>
In wisdom, strength and courage<br>
Growing day by day<br>
Solidly united<br>
By our motto sound<br>
Simple in virtue<br>
Strong in duty bound<br>
In duty to our country<br>
Let us steadfast be<br>
Serving it with cheerfulness<br>
And with loyalty<br>
Let us ever noble be<br>
In thought and word and deed<br>
Striving to our utmost<br>
Always to succeed
