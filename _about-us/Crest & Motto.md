## Crest

<img src="/images/badge&motto.jpg" style="width:60%">

This badge or crest was created by IJ pupils in 17th century France incorporating into its concept and design, values and aspirations which they wished to be lived out in each CHIJ School. Their design is still proudly worn by thousands of CHIJ pupils in the 21st century.

This badge is a symbol of the international unity binding together pupils from every continent, especially CHIJ pupils from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Japan.

## Motto

<img src="/images/About%20Us/CHIJ%20Motto.png" align="center">

This motto is easy to remember but requires a lifetime of practice.

**_Simple in Virtue_**<br>
This translates into the cultivation of a personal honesty that frees us to relate to others with respect, openness and sincerity, and to become disinterested seekers of truth, wisdom and all that is good. It is the core from which we operate.

**_Steadfast in Duty_**<br>
This translates into the strength of character necessary to commit oneself to a goal. It embraces the capacity to rise above the difficulties and obstacles encountered in the execution and completion of any task or duty undertaken in the service of others.

As a Catholic Mission School, the term “virtue” in its spiritual sense is a distinctive character trait or quality inspired and nurtured by a genuine desire to live according to God’s will as revealed in the Gospel.

The term “duty” expresses our response to what we discern to be God’s call to us. Love is therefore the underpinning of a life lived faithfully in the pursuit of these ideals.
