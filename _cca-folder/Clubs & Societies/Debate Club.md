<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>At CHIJ Katong Convent, the Debate Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) nurtures
articulate, confident, and critical thinkers who are passionate about expressing
ideas and engaging in meaningful discussions. Our Debate CCA provides a
platform for students to hone their public speaking skills, build persuasive
arguments, and develop a sharp, analytical mind. Through regular practice
sessions, workshops, and competitions, debaters are trained to think on
their feet, research thoroughly, and present compelling viewpoints with
poise and clarity. Beyond technical skills, the CCA also emphasizes sportsmanship,
teamwork, and respect for diverse perspectives — values that are essential
both in and outside the debating arena.</p>
<h4><strong>Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The Debate CCA runs a series of carefully structured programmes throughout
the year to ensure the holistic development of every debater:</p>
<p>Weekly Training Sessions: Students participate in engaging practice debates,
guided by experienced coaches who provide constructive feedback to refine
their style and technique.</p>
<p>Friendly Spars: To strengthen their skills and boost their confidence,
CHIJ Katong Convent organizes friendly sparring sessions with other schools,
offering debaters valuable opportunities to practice and grow in an encouraging
and lively setting.</p>
<p>Participation in National Competitions: Students represent the school
in prestigious debate championships such as the Singapore Secondary Schools
Debating Championships (SSSDC) and Raffles Institution U-14s Debating Championships
and other competitions gaining invaluable exposure and experience.</p>
<p>Mentorship Programme: Senior debaters mentor juniors, fostering a strong
community spirit and providing peer support in skill development and competition
preparation.</p>
<p>Through these programmes, Katong Convent’s Debate CCA aims to cultivate
eloquent, thoughtful leaders who are well-prepared to make meaningful contributions
to society.</p>
