The programme for Week 1 ended on a high note, with the much-awaited CCA Fair and briefing session for the Secondary One students on Friday 6 January.
Before the start of the CCA fair, Subject Head PE & CCA, Mr Ho Shi An, briefed the Secondary One students on the objectives of Co-Curricular Programmes (CCP) in MOE secondary schools and the important role that Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) play in instilling skills, values and 21st Century Competencies in our students. Mr Ho also briefed students on the CCA allocation exercise in KC, the process by which the Secondary One students will select and be assigned a CCA.
This year, Secondary 1 students were allowed to freely visit the various beautifully decorated CCA booths in-person to find out more about the various CCAs. Our senior students at the booths also showed that they were adept and engaging presenters. They were well prepared and enthusiastic about sharing with the Secondary One students what their CCA was about. All CCA teachers were also on hand to answer any further queries. The Secondary 1 students were given an opportunity to observe demonstrations by sports CCAs and enjoy live performances by the some of the performing arts groups.
