CCA Fair & Secondary One Meet-The-Parents-Session

CCA Fair and Meet-the-Parents session for the parents of Secondary One students were conducted on Saturday, 4 January. The programme started with a rousing performance by KC’s very own Concert Band, followed by the Principal, Ms Chan’s address.

During the Principal’s address, the parents were treated to a video montage of the activities that their daughters experienced during the Week 0 programme. Ms Chan also shared with parents strategies that their daughters can employ to aid them in adjusting to secondary school life.

The HOD/ CCA &amp; PE, Ms Priscilla Humphries, then briefed parents and the Secondary One students, on the objectives of Co-Curricular Programmes (CCP) in MOE secondary school and the important role that Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) play in instilling skills, values and 21st Century Competencies in our students. Ms Humphries also briefed parents and students on the CCA allocation exercise in KC, the process by which the Secondary One students will select and be assigned a CCA.

After the briefing, the parents attended a Meet-the-Parents session with their daughter’s form teachers, in which they shared matters pertaining to student well-being and the various communication platforms for parents to access school information.

All activities were in full swing when our Secondary 1 students and their parents toured the beautifully decorated booths and displays prepared by all the CCA groups in the school, providing them with plenty of information to help students make informed choices. All CCA teachers were also on hand to answer any further queries from the parents. The Secondary one students were given an opportunity to try out different sports such as bowling, badminton, netball and floorball, and view performances put up by the Chinese Drama and Dramatic Arts Society. Some even had a chance to try their hand at playing an instrument at the Chinese Orchestra booth.

The event was a success and KC would like to thank all parents who attended the event on an early Saturday morning.
