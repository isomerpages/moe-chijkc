#### Introduction

CHIJ Katong Convent is one of the few privileged schools in Singapore with a Chinese Drama&nbsp;CCA, led by our experienced instructor cum drama practitioner who is very active in the drama&nbsp;scene. Under her tutelage, our CCA has grown from strength to strength even during the&nbsp;pandemic. Our students are a close-knit team who has built rapport and fostered great&nbsp;friendship while learning a myriad of drama techniques. At the same time, they are also&nbsp;exposed to backstage technicalities like making of props, designing sound and lighting effects.
	
Our students may not have the best spoken and written Mandarin, but they definitely have wonderful opportunities afforded to them through SYF presentations, school performances and appreciation of professional plays.
