<h4><strong>Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>The Chinese Orchestra programme seeks to promote Chinese culture and cultivate
a deep appreciation for music within the Katong Convent community. At the
same time, it strives to create a nurturing and inclusive environment where
members can forge strong bonds and develop a strong sense of team spirit
through shared musical experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The Chinese Orchestra programme aims to develop studentsâ€™ instrumental
mastery and deepen their understanding of the skills and knowledge essential
to Chinese Orchestra. Students will have opportunities to learn and perform
new music pieces for a variety of internal and external platforms, while
also cultivating an appreciation for stage presentation, concert etiquette,
and rehearsal awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of their musical journey, students may choose to sit for grading
examinations conducted by established and accredited music exam boards,
allowing them to challenge themselves and pursue higher levels of mastery
in line with their personal goals. Throughout the programme, emphasis is
placed on music appreciation, expression, and application, encouraging
students to grow as well-rounded musicians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond musical development, students will plan and carry out Values-in-Action
(VIA) initiatives that highlight the role of music in community service.
Senior members also serve as mentors, guiding their juniors and fostering
a shared sense of purpose and pride in using music to give back to the
community.</p>
