#### Objectives

To create a supportive atmosphere where students can grow as musicians and as individuals, while at the same time striving for the highest level of musicianship possible.

To develop leadership skills and to instill self-discipline.

Through key programmes, students learn to display values like teamwork, perseverance, dedication and a mindset of excellence.

Band members can look forward to a high quality music education that provides opportunities for exchange programmes, competitions, workshops and performances. Throughout the year, all members attend numerous concerts performed by various ensembles, such as the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. The concert band has taken part in exchange programmes with ensembles such as the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Macau Youth Symphonic Band and West Winds. The band has also worked with renowned conductors and composers such as Yo Goto, Toro Miura, Frank Tryoka and Richard Saucedo.

#### Achievements

On their first overseas trip to the Hong Kong Winter Band Festival (2012), the band received a Gold award. The band has also attained Certificates of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (2013 - 2019). In addition, its clarinet ensemble won the First Prize at the Singapore Clarinet Festival Ensemble Competition (2015).
