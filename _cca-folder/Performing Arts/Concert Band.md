#### Objectives

To create a supportive atmosphere where students can grow as musicians, individuals, and leaders while at the same time striving for the highest level of musicianship possible.

Band members can look forward to a high quality music education that provides
opportunities for exchange programmes, competitions, workshops and performances.

#### About the KC Concert Band
Established in 2010, the CHIJ Katong Convent Concert Band has grown rapidly under the baton of Mr. Sim Kim Seng and Mr Ong Yeow Tong. Despite being relatively new, the concert band made quick and considerable strides, winning 5 consecutive Gold awards at the biannual Singapore International Band Festival Competition (2012–2022).
The band has also attained 9 consecutive Certificates of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (2013 - 2023). In addition, its clarinet ensemble won the First Prize at the Singapore Clarinet Festival Ensemble Competition (2015).

Throughout the year, all members attend numerous concerts performed by various ensembles, such as the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. In addition to their exposure to excellent musical works, the concert band has taken part in exchange programmes with ensembles such as the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Macau Youth Symphonic
Band and West Winds. The band has also worked with renowned conductors and composers such as Yo Goto, Frank Tryoka, Richard Saucedo, Dennis Fisher and Surapol Thanyawibool.
