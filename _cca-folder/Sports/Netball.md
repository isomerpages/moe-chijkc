#### Objectives

*   To develop the child holistically in skills, discipline, teamwork and values.
*   To inculcate good sportsmanship and leadership qualities.
*   To give every player an opportunity to participate in competitive games (either friendly matches or Nationals).
*   To qualify for National School Games Competition (B Division Girls and C Division Girls).

#### Programme (Lower Sec)

We adapt a generalised approach to initial training in Secondary one with the emphasis on the development of general, fundamental motor skills and technical/tactical skills. Participants should begin to specialise in positional play when they have developed an understanding of the sport and positional movements on court.

Our programme will develop the a lower secondary student in three core areas:

*   Technical and tactical skill development
*   Physical preparation — emphasis on core competencies
*   Athlete wellbeing and discipline

#### Programme (Upper Sec)

In the upper secondary years, players are ready to consolidate their basic sport-specific skills and tactics. It is also a major fitness development stage, where fitness is key during a competition.

Players will also be trained to be more versatile on court to take on more than one positional play. Her understanding of court movement and game strategies will be deepened and she will also be exposed to umpiring and statistical analysis skills.

Players will be developed through programs which provide intensive, high quality training and competition opportunities.

To maximise players’ long-term potential, winning should remain a secondary emphasis. This approach is critical to the long-term development of top performers and lifelong participants in the sport – Netball!
