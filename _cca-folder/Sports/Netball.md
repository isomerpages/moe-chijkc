<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To develop the child holistically in skills, discipline, teamwork and
values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To inculcate good sportsmanship and leadership qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To give every player an opportunity to participate in competitive games
(either friendly matches or Nationals).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To qualify for National School Games Competition (B Division Girls and
C Division Girls).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Programme (Lower Sec)</h4>
<p>We adapt a generalised approach to initial training in Secondary one with
the emphasis on the development of general, fundamental motor skills and
technical/tactical skills. Participants should begin to specialise in positional
play when they have developed an understanding of the sport and positional
movements on court.</p>
<p>Our programme will develop the a lower secondary student in three core
areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Technical and tactical skill development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical preparation — emphasis on core competencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Athlete wellbeing and discipline</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Programme (Upper Sec)</h4>
<p>In the upper secondary years, players are ready to consolidate their basic
sport-specific skills and tactics. It is also a major fitness development
stage, where fitness is key during a competition.</p>
<p>Players will also be trained to be more versatile on court to take on
more than one positional play. Her understanding of court movement and
game strategies will be deepened and she will also be exposed to umpiring
and statistical analysis skills.</p>
<p>Players will be developed through programs which provide intensive, high
quality training and competition opportunities.</p>
<p>To maximise players’ long-term potential, winning should remain a secondary
emphasis. This approach is critical to the long-term development of top
performers and lifelong participants in the sport – Netball!
<br>
<br><strong><u>Friendly matches and carnivals </u></strong>
<br>KC netball participates in friendly matches and carnivals throughout the
year to provide all netballers with opportunities to gain match experience.
During matches, participants strengthen their mental fortitude, teamwork,
and ability to apply their training to achieve growth and success. By strengthening
our students, we raise the overall level of competency and competitiveness
of our KC netball team
