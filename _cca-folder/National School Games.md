#### National School Games 2022 Report

After a two-year hiatus, the National School Games (NSG) was finally back in full swing in March 2022. Six of KC’s sports and games CCAs took part in the NSG, and we also supported students in four other sports that are not official school CCAs. The following is a report of the games that took place this year.

**Floorball**<br>
Our floorball B Division girls were the first group to compete this year. For many, this was also the first time they were competing in the NSG. They got off to a great start, with a win against their first opponents, St Theresa’s Convent. They then went on to win more matches to qualify for the quarter finals. Although they did not make it into the semi finals, our girls played their hearts out for all their matches, displayed resilience and certainly did the school proud. 

Our C Division girls were next to take the stage in August. They were undefeated in both rounds 1 and 2, and eventually emerged victorious in their 3rd/ 4th placing match against Orchid Park Secondary School.

Despite the arduous skills-focused training and competition matches which required mindful time management, KC Floorball maintained high spirits and displayed camaraderie as well as sportsmanship throughout the tournament.

**Netball**<br>
Our netball B Division girls were the next group to go out there and represent our school at the NSG. They too, did well in their first match against Tampines Secondary. Our netballers showed grit and determination, and did not back down even when the going was tough and they were trailing behind on points in a match. Although they did not eventually qualify for the quarter finals with three wins out of five games, we are proud of them and all the hard work that they put in during training in the lead up to the games. Our C Division team, who played in the NSG in July, also displayed a lot of perseverance. Despite their tender age and relative inexperience, they supported each other throughout all the playoff matches and displayed great sportsmanship.

**Badminton**<br>
To prepare for the NSG, our badminton players not only had their usual face-to-face sessions; they supplemented it with several e-CCA sessions too. The players representing KC at the NSG committed time and energy to attend CCA thrice a week from January to March this year to further hone their skills and game play. The B division girls competed against three schools in the preliminary round, putting up a strong fight against our closest competitors St. Anthony's Canossian Secondary School. We emerged second place in the group and made it to the quarter finals. Although competition in the quarter finals was very tough, our girls fought very hard and gave their best. Despite not advancing to the semi finals, our badminton girls displayed strength and resilience, and showed great sportsmanship towards all opponents as well as towards their own teammates. 

**Track & Field**<br>
The NSG track and field championship took place at Bukit Gombak Stadium over a month long period, and involved numerous schools from across the country. Our girls were as anxious - as they were eager - to return to the track, having not had competitions in two years. Through unfavourable weather conditions at times and the pressure to surpass their personal best, every KC athlete took up the challenge with good cheer and emerged from each race stronger and having learned something from the experience. We would like to commend every one of our track and field athletes for their hard work and achievements. We would also like to congratulate the following girls on advancing to the next stage, or attaining medals in their events:

**Canoeing**<br>
Our KC girls were not only competing on court and on the track; we also had 19 Secondary 2 – 4 girls representing us on the water! Our canoeists were excited to  test their mettle against peers from many schools all over Singapore, during the National School Games (NSG) for canoeing, which was held from 4 – 7 April at MacRitchie Reservoir. For many of them it was their first outing at the NSG. Despite canoeing in unfamiliar waters and facing inclement weather that sometimes postponed or delayed the events, the canoeists persevered and rose to the occasion to complete all their races. 

They participated in these events:

|  |  |  |
|---:|:---:|:---|
| **B Division** | **B Division** | **C Division** |
| K1 – 500m | K1 - 1000m | K1 - 500m |
| K2 – 500m | K4 - 1000m | K4 - 500m |
| K4 – 500m | | JK1 - 500m |
| JK1 – 500m | | JK2 - 500m |
|  |  |  |


We would like to commend Tan Wen Yan from Sec 301 for clinching a place in the finals for the K1-1000m race and coming in 6th place.  

**Bowling**<br>
Between 4th and 8th April, 16 KC bowlers from Secondary 3, 4 and 5 took part in the bowling championships. Amongst the teams that our bowlers competed against were traditional powerhouses such as Singapore Sports School, Methodist Girls’ School and St Margaret’s Secondary School Throughout the games, our bowlers displayed perseverance, teamwork, and fine bowling skills. Despite the stiff competition, we are pleased to share that KC emerged 6th overall for this year’s Tenpin Bowling 'B' Division Championship. <br>
In July, it was our C Division bowlers’ turn to compete. Time and again, their skills and grit were tested, and it was very proud to announce that they rose to the challenge, and emerged 4th overall (Team).

**Non-CCA Sports**<br>
As a caring school that excels, we want to support out students’ sporting aspirations in sports that are not part of the school’s CCAs. <br>
This year, we sent a total of 5 students across four different sports to the NSG, to compete in golf, rhythmic gymnastics, swimming and wushu. <br>
Jeryn Wong from Sec 105 was our representative at the golf championships this year. The championship, held at Laguna National Golf Resort Club, had a rainy delayed start that morning. Coupled with the fact that this was the first time Jeryn was competing in the NSG, she was understandably nervous. Our young golfer, however, remained calm and persevered in the rain over the two days, completing all 18 holes, seeing an improvement in her scores by the end of the competition.  

For the first time, KC had a representative at the wushu competition, in Ashley Quek from Sec 405. It was an intense competition, and as no spectators or team managers were allowed into the venue during the competition, Ashley took guidance from her coach and had to steady herself on her own on the competition mat. She learnt a lot from the experience and we are proud of her for taking this on in her graduating year. 

For rhythmic gymnastics, we had Claire Ng from Sec 405 competing in the hoop, ribbon, ball and clubs events, and brought back double Bronze medals for her beautifully graceful and technically challenging routines in the hoop and ribbons categories.  

In swimming, we had competitors in both the B and C Divisions, with Claire Pang from Sec 205 competing in the 200m and 400m freestyle event, and Francesca Lee from Sec 403 competing in the 50m and 100m freestyle events. Both girls held their own and did well against traditional powerhouses at the meet; Claire even brought home a medal when she came in 4th place in the 200m freestyle event!
