<h4>LEAPS 2.0 - CCA Grading System</h4>
<p><strong>Leadership - Enrichment - Achievement - Participation - Service</strong>
</p>
<p>LEAPS 2.0 seeks to shape co-curricular experiences that encourage students
to develop skills and competencies that would enable them to lead a meaningful
and purposeful life, and be prepared for an uncertain and changing world.
LEAPS 2.0 recognises students' experiential learning and attainment in
the four domains of the co-curriculum as they progress through their secondary
school years.</p>
<p>1 ) <strong>Participation</strong> - affirms students' sustained development
in school-based CCA throughout secondary school
<br>
</p>
<p>2 ) <strong>Achievement</strong> - affirms students' character development
and efforts in representing the school/ external organisations in events
<br>
</p>
<p>3 ) <strong>Leadership</strong> - affirms students' development as a leader
<br>
</p>
<p>4 ) <strong>Service</strong> - affirms students' contributions to the community
and development as responsible and active citizens</p>
<p>There are five levels of attainment in each domain. At the end of the
graduating year, students' co-curricular attainment will be recognised.
This recognition will be translated into bonus point/s which can be used
for admission to Junior Colleges/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of Technical
Education (JC/ Poly/ ITE).</p>
<p>The Enrichment domain complements the above four domains for students'
holistic development and will be recognised in the School Graduation Certificate.</p>
